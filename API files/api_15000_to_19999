15006,Advice,"['Grid Movement', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Square Grid']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Advice is a sort of checkers variant; each player has four types of piece: priests, lawyers, psychiatrists, and a single &quot;citizen&quot; whom the rest of the pieces try to shepherd to it's goal across the board. Pieces can move a single space or jump any other pieces any number of times. If a piece jumps a subordinate piece of the opponent, it is captured and removed from play. Priests beat lawyers, lawyers beat psychiatrists, and psychiatrists beat priests. Any piece can capture the citizen. The board is a 9x9 grid of squares; each player starts from a home corner and moves towards the opposite (opponents) corner. On every move, a piece must end up farther forward than it began.<br/><br/>A number of variants are provided, e.g. &quot;Dictator&quot; where there is no capturing, and one in which players may set up their pieces as they wish.<br/><br/>Created by a psychiatrist, the pieces are modeled &quot;according to WH Sheldon's somatotypes&quot; - &quot;priests are round, comfortable, and cuddly, lawyers square and forceful, psychiatrists triangular, lean and edgy.&quot;<br/><br/>",1976,,,
15007,Carapace,['Variable Player Powers'],['Abstract Strategy'],"Carapace is something like a refined fox-and-hounds: The two players have different sets of pieces, and the offensive player can always capture the defensive pieces eventually. In a game, each player plays each role once, and the player who eliminated the defense in the fewest moves wins the game.<br/><br/>The board is composed of rectangular spaces arranged like bricks in a wall, making it effectively hexagonal. There are blocked spaces where no one can move, and three sets of differently colored &quot;closable&quot; spaces - when an offensive piece is on a colored square, similarly colored squares are off limits to the defense. There are also squares numbered 1 - 3; when a defensive piece lands on one of these, the number is added to the offensive player's move total.<br/><br/>",1970,,,
15008,King Kangaroo,['Point to Point Movement'],['Abstract Strategy'],"Not quite Chinese Checkers:<br/><br/>&quot;It may interest readers to know that this game originated when the Inventor was faced with entertaining the Allied Forces during the last war so that they could, at least for an hour or two, be drawn away from thoughts of their normal surroundings. Having in a measure achieved his objective he set himself the task of making the game public, for the first time, in early December 1948, when King Kangaroo appeared for sale in the leading London Departmental Stores, such as Selfridges, Hamleys, Army &amp; Navy Stores, DH Evans, Bentalls, etc.<br/>King Kangaroo is therefore an entirely NEW GAME of which the Inventor holds the Patent and manufacturing rights as also the Copyrights of the rules for the United Kingdom and World Patents are pending.&quot;<br/><br/>The differences from the standard game are that the pieces cannot move at all without jumping, and can jump any number of adjacent pieces. There is also a single &quot;King Kangaroo&quot; piece per player, which functions slightly differently.<br/><br/>[Edit by Derek Carve:  Not &quot;brazen&quot; as [originally] implied above [point taken].  It is certainly played on a Chinese Checkers board but, come to that, many totally original games are played on a draughts board (Lines of Action is a good example) without being a re-packaging of draughts.   In this truly excellent game, as correctly explained, the pieces move totally differently from Chinese Checkers BUT one piece on each side - the King - has to be different from the rest in some way.  This is why it cannot be played with a standard set of Chinese Checkers unless, of course, one is prepared to paint some of the pieces.]<br/><br/>",1948,,,

Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.<br/><br/>The active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:<br/>1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). <br/>2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.<br/>3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. <br/>Note: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.<br/><br/>You score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.<br/><br/>The game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Note: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.<br/><br/>Advanced rules<br/><br/>A windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

15044,Inchon,"['Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']","['Korean War', 'Wargame']","Inchon depicts the Korean War's most famous battle, the U.S. and South Korean amphibious landings that led to the liberation of Seoul and, coupled with the defeat of the last North Korean assault on the Pusan Perimeter, turned the tide of the war (until, that is, Communist China intervened in force). The map scale is 1.7 kilometers per hex. The game lasts 12 turns that evidently equate to days. Units are companies and armored platoons for the U.S./ROK, mostly battalions for North Korea (whose army the rulebook consistently calls by its Korean name, &quot;In Min Gun&quot; or &quot;IMG&quot;). Higher level headquarters units implement the game's (rather restrictive and cumbersome) command rules.<br/><br/>The components are typical of Simulations Canada: a plain but functional two-color map, simple counters and a small, tightly printed rulebook. U.S. Marine and Army counters are shades of green, South Korean shades of red, North Korean a uniform brown. Counters are one-sided, with the back giving setup or arrival information for the historical scenarios.<br/><br/>The U.S./ROK side earns victory points by seizing objectives in and around Seoul, the enemy by inflicting casualties. As alternatives to the historical setup and reinforcement schedules, the U.S./ROK may use a free setup, or the IMG may receive more rapid reinforcements.<br/><br/>Game turns are divided into &quot;impulses&quot;, a concept borrowed from White Death, a Frank Chadwick design. In each of its impulses, a side may use all or some of its 9 &quot;movement points&quot; (but always at least one). The impulses alternate until all movement points are exhausted or neither player wants to do anything further that turn. The system is attractive in principle but may bog down in practice. It also requires record keeping, as air, naval and artillery units may bombard only once per turn rather than once per impulse.<br/><br/>Although all units have the same 9 movement points, how far they in fact can go differs by type - tracked vehicle, foot, support (wheeled vehicle) or &quot;irregular&quot; - and by morale class. If, for instance, a player divides his turn into three impulses, an &quot;A&quot; class armored platoon can potentially move 45 hexes along a road, while &quot;C&quot; class infantry company could advance 9 at most. Higher class units are also less likely to break in combat and can operate effectively at a greater distance from their HQ's. Out-of-supply units are slowed down. Those suppressed by bombardment may not move at all.<br/><br/>According to the designer's notes, &quot;In the historic scenario most play-tests ended with the UN player getting most of his objectives, though about half the time he was not able to secure the Seoul capital hex in time. As a result the game usually turned on how high a casualty level was sustained to get these objectives. . . . In the various Free UN landing and Rapid IMG reinforcement scenarios playtests indicated just about anything could happen.&quot;<br/><br/>",1981,,,

It is traditionally played with a special deck of cards called the William Tell deck. The deck has 32 cards - like a modern Skat deck - but uses German suits (Bells, Hearts, Leaves, Acorns).<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Ulti is a trick-taking game for three players. In each hand the player who wins the bidding chooses trumps (or no trumps) and plays alone against the other two players in partnership.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 10 cards. The start player is allowed to look at and swap with the two cards left over (called a Talon). Once they have done this they must make a bid. Each player in turn can choose to look at the Talon and swap cards with it but if they do they must make a bid which is of higher value than the previous one.<br/><br/>Numerous different value bids can be made. These range from winning the hand, taking the last trick with the seven of the trump suit (Ulti), loosing every trick (Betli) or winning every trick (Durchmars). The value of most of these bids can be doubled by playing the Heart suit as the trump card. If a player thinks the winning bid will not be successful he can make a bid saying this when he plays the first trick (called a Kontra). At the end of the hand, if he is correct he will get double points (or money if playing for money.)<br/><br/>Once the bid has been finalized the players play out the tricks. When the tricks have been finished the players see if the bid was successful. If the bid was successful the losing players give the winner the value of the bid (points or money). If the bid was unsuccessful the loser gives the other two players the value of the bid. If a player has called a Kontra he gets double points.<br/><br/>Ulti has no fixed end point and players can play as many hands as they have time for.<br/><br/>",0,,,

If you own and play ASL Starter Kit #1 you will be pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to spot the new rules ASLSK#2 adds - we've highlighted the new rules so that you can skip rereading what you've learned in ASLSK#1 and get right to the new rules!<br/><br/>What does ASLSK#2 add? GUNS! Artillery pieces. Anti-tank guns. The famous and deadly German &quot;88&quot;. Mortars and bazookas! ASLSK#2 adds the &quot;to hit&quot; procedure to the foundation you learned in ASLSK#1. And if you didn't get ASLSK#1? There are two &quot;infantry only&quot; scenarios to get you up to speed!<br/><br/>This answers the inevitable question we get with the Starter Kit concept. Do I need ASLSK#2 if I have ASLSK#1? The Starter Kits are self contained.

We do not anticipate changing what you've learned from prior Starter Kits (for example, ASLSK#2 adds about 4 pages of rules to the base built by ASLSK#1). A better question would be &quot;Do I need ASLSK#1 if I buy ASLSK#2?&quot;. The short answer is a resounding no! You can dive right in with ASLSK#2. But if you do, and you like the game, ASLSK#1 adds more boards and scenarios (infantry only) for you to enjoy.

This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           <br/>           <br/>The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large &ldquo;battles&rdquo; &ndash; six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           <br/>           <br/>The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo; of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           <br/>           <br/>The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios.

The players create armies of different sizes and nationalities and must use all of the skill and knowledge of strategy they possess to defeat their opponents. Rules are provided on how to play the games, but these can be looked upon as guidelines. It will constantly be stressed that this is your system and the rules can be altered to suit your particular style of play. The games can be played as simple or complicated as you prefer. Because of the endless variety of combat situations which can be constructed, we hope players will never tire of the system.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;We offer 5 books within the system, each one covering 300 weapons. There are 2 aircraft books, 2 naval books and 1 armor book. This means a total of 1,500 weapons are covered. A total of over 1,000,000 of these weapons were produced and we provide production figures for all of them. Our playing pieces are larger than those offered by other gaming companies and are presented in a variety of shapes which look like the weapons they have been chosen to represent. Our playing pieces are available in four different 4 color camouflage patterns. A national insignia sheet is also available in full color and contains over 500 insignias from over a dozen countries. When applied to the playing pieces, these insignias combined with the size, shape and camouflage patterns provide an air of realism and excitement never before attainable at the price they are offered.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Because of the larger size of our playing pieces, it stands to reason our hexes must be larger to accommodate them. In keeping with our policy of non-restriction, a stencil is available within our system which allows the player to trace this hex pattern across any playing surface they choose. A readily available and inexpensive playing surface is poster board (22&quot; x 28&quot;). Two of these boards butted together make a good beginner size and three boards make a good overall size for any type of gaming activity. These boards can be left plain, or full color scenarios can be drawn on them prior to tracing the hex pattern. Even those players with limited artistic ability can create personalized scenarios with a little time and patience. Maps can be purchased of oceans, continents and individual countries. These maps are relatively inexpensive, are good size for gaming and make for an extremely attractive playing surface. County survey maps can also be acquired, as well as city and county street indexes for those who wish to engage in street fighting. A hex pattern sheet is also provided with our stencil which can be inexpensively reprinted at your local quickie printer.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A map or scenario can also be applied to a window shade and our design traced across it. The shade can be stretched across the playing area and retained at the ends while in use. For those with a permanent playing table, shade brackets can be attached to one edge of the table and the shade snapped in. The pull tab can be retained at the opposite edge with the aid of a nail. In this way the shade will rest squarely on the table top and remain taut. A variety of shades can be prepared and used as they are needed. This should be especially appealing for clubs. Games can also be played on non-hex surfaces by simply substituting inches for hex speed, which is contained in the WARGAME CHARTS. Remember, we will recommend how the games should be played, but the final decision is up to you.&quot;<br/><br/>",1980,,,

You must throw doubles before you can move (thus starting a fire), but after that you can move regardless of what you roll. Each time a double of a house already on fire is rolled, a block from that building is removed.<br/><br/>To put out a fire, both spaces in front of a building must be occupied by a fire engine. Each truck then scores points equal to the remaining number of blocks for that building. If you own both fire engines, the second truck scores double points as a bonus.

Each &lsquo;turn&rsquo; of the game simulates an over of Test or One Day Cricket. Turns are resolved by using a regular deck of playing cards instead of rolling dice, although six sided dice are used to resolve some plays. The device of replicating a single over per turn is perfect, as full test matches can be played over several hours, while one day games can be played out in a single session. The system ingeniously allows for hat tricks, batting collapses, batsmen playing themselves in, and batsman playing with confidence. There are two forms of the game. Basic, which only include some rules and in which players are not individually carded (although they do have individual stats) and the Advanced Game, in which each player has a unique card.<br/><br/>It produces a very convincing range of scores and excitement (perhaps rather more than the real game does). Extremely clever.<br/><br/>The 5th Edition of this game is now available from mindencricket.com<br/><br/>",1979,,,

If the player has the fruit asked for, he must give it up, unless he has the guard of that fruit; for example, if one player asks another for an apple which he has, if he also holds the dog, he may refuse, saying, &quot;My apples are guarded by my dog.&quot;<br/><br/>You continue calling for fruit until you call on a person who either doesn't have any or has the guard for that set. Once stopped, all players draw 2 cards from the player to their left. Guards cannot be called away, but since they are frequently passed, their location is often doubtful. When you collect all 4 cards in a set, you lay them down in front of you. The player with the most sets at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>",1887,,,

As in real football the object is to advance the ball over the opponents goal line for a score. Dice rolls are used for all aspects of the game. The kickoff, for example, travels a distance equal to 5 times the throw of the dice. The receiving player then rolls the dice for the return; if it's an even number, the ball is brought back the number of yards rolled, but if it's an odd number no gain is made. The offense may choose either a Line Plunge, an End Run, a Forward Pass, or a Trick Play. The greater a play's potential for gain, the greater risk of no gain or a loss of yards. A roll of doubles results in either a penalty or a turnover. When the time limit agreed upon by the players (before the game) is reached, the player who has the highest total score is the winner.<br/><br/>",1948,,,

It began as a research project in 1967 by Dr. Julian Compton (1940-2010), a Florida A&amp;M humanities professor and boxing authority. The heavyweights were evaluated on up to 155 variables. The table game was first produced by Gamecraft in 1976. The computerized version was first released in 2004 which is set up similarly to the board game. The computer implementation was done by NASA programmer Don Mankowski.<br/><br/>Data Boxing features yesterdays legends and hall of famers reflecting the glory days of years gone by. You'll find Ali, Marciano, Dempsey, Louis, Tunney, Foreman, Frazier, Baer, Braddock and more. To quote the designer of the game, Dr. Julian Compton, from a Data Boxing Newsletter (in 1977), &quot;One of the real thrills for this game player is to see the stars of the past come alive in a game structure. Usually these names will be familiar, but ever so often an unknown will rear his head in a bid for greatness.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing is &quot;the boxer's Boxing Game&quot;. It's a detailed, realistic simulation of boxing where boxers of all eras are matched.  There is a real component to it because it's based on the actual performance of boxers. Individual fighters are rated on cards, and bouts are resolved through dice and charts and/or rounds cards (see Data Boxing II below). To quote Dr. Compton, &quot;The game was popular with boxing writers, due to its obvious awareness of information below the headlines of boxing history, and its mathematical structure, which allowed for the matchup of boxing greats from different time periods.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing allows you to choose the level of complexity with which you are most comfortable. To quote from the 1980 edition of Data Boxing produced by Big League Game Company, &quot;Data Boxing is one of the most detailed and accurate sports games you can play. It is hoped you can find the level which will give you all the enjoyment that others have had, whether you are 6 or 96. It is a game you can play for a lifetime.&quot;<br/><br/>Data Boxing was featured in the December 1977 edition of Ring Magazine, the May 1977 and December 1977 editions of Boxing Illustrated, The People's Almanac [1978], Computer Sports Matchups [1981], the December 13th, 2006 issue of the Tallahassee Democrat and the BoxRec Wiki Encyclopedia.

Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.<br/><br/>Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.<br/><br/>All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

15549,Casinò,['Betting and Bluffing'],['Number'],"Roulette is a French word meaning &quot;small wheel&quot;. It is the oldest casino game still in existence today. The exact origins of the game are unknown - there's probably been gambling using a wheel since the invention of the wheel. Some say it was invented in 1655 by the French scientist Blaise Pascal while working on a perpetual motion machine. Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. <br/> The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single &quot;0&quot; roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.<br/> The single &quot;0&quot; wheel became known as the &quot;French Wheel&quot;. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero &quot;00&quot; was also added and this became known as the &quot;American Wheel&quot;. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.<br/><br/>Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).<br/><br/>When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off. <br/> ",1796,,,

In return you'll gain a deeper understanding of how others see you.<br/><br/>This boardgame (without a board!) works like this: an Analyst asks questions about a randomly-drawn subject.

Since you need to roll a 6 to start a marble on the track, you can use a 6 on either die or the total of the two. Like backgammon, you can move 2 pieces by using the number on each die, or move 1 piece by using the total on both. If you roll doubles, you get to take an additional turn.

At least 20 different versions of Hoyle's have been published over the years, making it the best-selling series of books about games in history and giving rise to the popular phrase, according to Hoyle.<br/><br/>The title page of an edition published around 1900 reads as follows:<br/><br/>&quot;Hoyle's Games. America's Complete Hand-Book of Games, containing all the card games played in the United States, with their rules, regulations, technicalities, etc., adapted to the American mode of playing, from the text of Hoyle, and the best modern authorities. Also comprising Backgammon, Chess, Checkers, Billiards, Pool, Bagatelle, Bowls, etc., with numerous diagrams and engravings. Complete edition. Revised, corrected, and enlarged.&quot;<br/><br/>One confusing aspect about this book is that there is no trademark on the name Hoyle (just like there is no trademark on the name Webster's for dictionaries), so referring to a book as Hoyle's Games could refer to a number of different volumes.  The popular Hoyle's Games was first published in 1907, with at least ten editions published in the twentieth century.  Each edition added to, edited, and clarified what had been presented in the earlier edition.<br/><br/>",1742,,,

To add to the period flavor of the show, there were mixed-in movie slides from silent movies that told audience members &quot;Please Pay Attention,&quot; &quot;The Plot Thickens,&quot; etc. at critical points in the show.<br/><br/>Players keep traveling around the board from Madison High to Crawford's Ice Cream Parlor and back again.  They obtain &quot;Slogan&quot; cards and &quot;Word&quot; cards. The &quot;Slogans&quot; (familiar expressions of the 1920's) are worth points for score when a player collects the right words to complete the &quot;slogan&quot;.

The first 26 pgs are devoted to the battle, while the next eleven pgs are actual rules and the final ten pgs cover the charts, table, set-ups, etc. that come with a game. <br/>The map is in two pieces, each 11x17&rdquo; and looks amazingly like SPI&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wacht Am Rhein&rdquo; that I can see (my copy is MINT and I refuse to open it all up), including coloring and style. Judging by the fact that the game lasts five days of the campaign (the 16th to 20th of Dec) and the units included (no SS, but the 2nd PZ and Lehr Pz Divisions), I would guess that the game covers the opening assault by the 5th Panzer Army against Clervaux and the 28th US infantry division. <br/>The game has battalion-sized units almost exclusively. Units have only one combat number and some sort of morale or training rating as there are several units with one or two stars between the combat and movement numbers. The main thing is that the game uses strength points reduction-there are roster sheets for record-keeping of unit losses. The CRT is by strength point loss and there is a detailed chart for CRT modifiers, presumably for combined arms. Also, next to the strength point boxes are a number of boxes for each unit for each day. I would gather that the game tracks unit fatigue as well. There are barrage and range values on artillery and support and range numbers on the regimental HQ units.<br/><br/>",1983,,,
15685,Diadochoi: A Divided Uncompleted Empire,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Ancient', 'Wargame']","The game covers the ceaseless in-fighting amongst Alexander the Great&rsquo;s Generals after his death. The map stretches from Northern Macedonia and Benghazi in the west to the Caspian Sea in the east. The map uses a more naturalized look than most other AT games and is completely in Japanese, other than the title. Units are of indeterminate size, but include Elephants, ships, and leaders as well as infantry. Also, the counters use mostly Japanese characters, except for the Arabic numerals. <br/>Movement in the game looks to be controlled by leaders, with interception being available to the non-phasing player. Combat units are counted by points and the CRT is percentage-based for losses. The game runs 16 years (315-300 BC) with an impulse track or turn track (?) based on the seasons (9 boxes per year).<br/><br/><br/><br/>First Ad-technos edition<br/>SGB-2 Diadochoi--A divided uncompleted Empire (1983) (JPY 1500) <br/>The first 23 pages cover the history leading up to and concerning the game, including chapters on the generals, tactics of the time, and maps of the battle lines.

The map contains four 11x17&rdquo; pieces, making one whole map together. The map does not use full-hex terrain symbols but does include a vast array of set-up boxes for the different clans involved. <br/>As its name implies, this is a alternative history of the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. The counters have a combat and movement value with some of the troops having their combat number in parenthesis (the musket-armed troops I bet, but there does seen to be a lot of them). There is a neat time spiral in the middle of a roster page (what is recorded there, I have no idea), as the CRT is a &lsquo;push-style&rsquo; one, with the results of &lsquo;AD&rsquo;, &lsquo;AR&rsquo; &lsquo;Eng&rsquo;, &lsquo;DR&rsquo; and &lsquo;DD&rdquo;.

The player&rsquo;s PACs are tracking intensive, recording supplies, combat efficiency, reinforcement appearance, and much, much more. Many of the rules cover the interaction of the markers on the PACs during combat. I imagine most of the &lsquo;game&rsquo; here is managing your PAC correctly vis-&agrave;-vis the map.<br/><br/>Other counters include DD tanks, commandos, coastal artillery, strong points, naval bombardment and TAC air markers and a whole handful with Japanese text (which is somewhat rare in Japanese games actually).<br/><br/>This game is way up on my list of games needing translation. It almost looks like one of the old double-blind games (with the two identical maps), except that there are no apparent rules for those procedures. Maybe I received an extra map by mistake?

Only about 20 pgs contain the actual rules. The game appears to cover only one battle, broken into four scenarios with the campaign game being the last. Battle of Ravenna is unique in that it is the only Ad Technos game to ever have a mounted mapboard. It is very similar to what Avalon Hill used the early 90&rsquo;s with similar results (bowing of the map).<br/><br/>The counters each have five numbers on them-firepower, melee, movement and some sort of morale values (written as either + or -). There are a bunch of strength point counters as well to go along with the roster sheets. Most of the counters are in Japanese script.

There is a 28 pg rulebook and a 24 pg Historical Notes booklet.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than a modified version of Kevin Zucker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Campaigns of Napoleon&rdquo; system, period. The differences I can see are not using individual combat units with historical IDs, instead the designer chose to use icon units (such as artillery or infantry) combined with strength point markers to go underneath. Also, leaders are not on the map and forces are represented by numbered force markers instead. There is an AP Table, but no Attrition Table.

15702,Samas,['Rock-Paper-Scissors'],"['Abstract Strategy', 'Racing']","&quot;Samas&quot; is a simple abstract 2-player racing game that incorporates a &quot;Paper-Scissors-Stone &quot; mechanic to determine which player is allowed to move on the track towards the finishing space.<br/><br/>The board consists of a single track with 9 hollows. Each player places their Sama-stone on the second hole from their baseline. Both players also get 13 stones in their color, and 2  joker-stones. All these stones are kept hidden behind the player's screens.<br/><br/>Every turn each player secretly selects 0 to 3 regular stones, or a joker-stone. These are then simultaneously revealed, the Sama-stone of the player with the winning selection moves one place towards the opponent's side, and the stone-selection of both players are removed from play.<br/><br/>If both players reveal the same stone-selection, then these stones are still removed from play, but neither Sama-stone gets moved forwards. If a player runs out of stones then the opponent's Sama-stone moves 1 space forwards for each regular stone still in this player's reserve.<br/><br/>So what makes a winning selection? A selection of regular stones gets beaten by a higher amount of regular stones. A joker-stone beats any amount of regular stones. However, if a joker-stone is played when the opponent decided to play no stones at all, than it in turn is beaten.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player reaches the opposite side of the board, or until a player runs out of stones to play. The winner is predictably the player who reaches, or gets closest to, the other side of the board.<br/><br/>Publishing history: Together with &quot;Trio Trio&quot;, &quot;Samas&quot; was the first of Frank's designs to get published (in 2004) in the deluxe wooden format that typifies the Clemens Gerhards range.

Its suit will serve as trumps.<br/>Then, each player announces whether they will take this card or not. If a player takes it, they receive the face-up card.

That makes for 8 cards for everyone.<br/>If no player takes the card, we take another round were each player announces if they take the card, but also announce the suit that will serve as trumps if they do (instead of the suit of the face-up card).<br/><br/>After that, it is similar to Tarot: First player plays a card, then each player can play a card of the same suit or a trump. If you can't play the led suit, you have to play a trump. If your partner wins the &quot;pli&quot; (trick), you don't have to play a trump.<br/>When 8 &quot;plis&quot; have been played (when no one has cards in their hand), points are counted.

Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.<br/><br/>Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.

The game board has spaces for 25 face-down chits but there are actually two sets of chits placed on top of each other, green and black; and black chits may only be searched (turned face-up) after ALL the green chits have been discovered. Instead of looking for one special chit that allows a player to win the game, the aim is to dig gold worth of $2000 and then head for the nearest starting point, which are located corners of the gameboard. At this point, other players however still have a chance to compete for victory, for if one of them manages to find the 'Letter from Home' chit among the black chits, that triggers an end-of-game race in which the first player to reach any corner is the winner. As an added bonus, the finder of the letter gets to double their movement afterwards, while other players (excluding the one who triggered the end of the game) have the added handicap that they have to visit Klondyke first.<br/><br/>The starting points are named after six well known gold diggers from this period: Big Hawk Haida, Annie &quot;Get Your Gun&quot; Oakley, James W. Marshall, Kit Carson, C. G. Larsson and Jim Bridger.

15878,500 Rum,"['Melding and Splaying', 'Set Collection']","['Card Game', ""Children's Game""]","There are many different versions of Rummy. Rummy 500 is the most commonly played form of Rummy. Rummy 500 is a standard deck playing card game using 52 cards.  It is one of the most popular family card games, and has a simple premise.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand.  You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the same value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit).  Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they can take the top face down card from the stock, or take the top face up card from the discard pile.  After melding, laying off, or making no plays on the table, a player must discard a card face up on the discard pile. The discard pile is spread out, so that the value of all cards is visible.  If you see a card that you can use, you may take it, but you must also take all the cards that have been discarded on top of it, and you must play the lowest (physical) card in the deck as soon as you pick it up. If you only take the top card of the discard pile, you do not have to meld it immediately. (Variant: No wait, actually you do.)<br/><br/>The hand ends as soon as one player discards her last remaining card (going out). Cards on the table are worth positive points, and cards left in your hand are worth negative points.  Numbered cards from 2-10 are worth their pip value (Variant: 2-9 are worth 5); face-cards are worth 10 points; aces are worth 15 points, unless used in an A-2-3 run; jokers are worth 15 points. (Variant: All players add up the pip values of the cards in their hands, and those points are given to the player who went out.) A player who goes out without previously laying down any cards goes &quot;rummy,&quot; and scores double the points. Normally, games are played to 500 points, but players can opt to play to fewer points, or play a specific number of rounds.<br/><br/>When playing with 2, both players get 13 cards.  When playing with 3 or 4, each player gets 7 cards.  When playing with 5 or 6 players, each player receives 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are many other variations of the game.  Early versions of Rummy were often played with a 44-card deck, Ace through 11 in four suits.  In the 2-player version players are dealt 8 cards, with 3 or more players, the hand size is 6 cards.<br/><br/>One such variation, Rommé, played in Germany, requires that a player cannot start laying any cards down at all, until they have broken in with a lay down valued at 40 points or more (the exception being if you can play all of the 13 cards in your hand in one go).  In the German variant, each face card is 10, number cards are worth their shown number, aces are worth 11 (if used after the king or as a set) or 1 if used as a 1 in front of a 2 in a sequence.  Jokers are the value of the card they are representing.  This German rummy variant is also played with 2x52 cards + 6(or 4) jokers - for a 110 card deck.  Another difference from American Rummy is that one can only pick up the top discard, from a single growing discard pile - never a larger part of a spread out discard deck. Rather than scoring points based on what you have laid down in front of you, the winner (first person out), gets zero, and every other player adds up the cards remaining in their hands and takes that much in points (adding up the deadwood)  Here the player that finished has no deadwood.  When someone reaches 500 (or agreed to goal) the game ends and the player with the lowest score (least penalty points) wins.  Because of this 'breaking through with 40+' rule, this game is a bit more difficult and closer to Gin Rummy.<br/><br/>Pagat.com considers the overlapping discard pile, from which a player can take any card plus all cards above it in the pile, to be the feature distinguishing Rummy 500 from basic Rummy. However, numerous other optional rules for each variant are also listed, some of which could be considered to be equally significant, and there is no consensus across the web as to what defines one or the other.<br/><br/>",1887,,,

This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.<br/><br/>The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.<br/><br/>Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins. If players are tied, the player with the single most valuable movie is the winner.<br/><br/>The Hollywood Card Game contains 64 cards, 16 film reel chips, and a rule sheet.

The game is played with a 40-card Italian deck (similar to a conventional deck minus either the 8s, 9s, and 10s or alternatively, the Js,  Qs, and Ks).  Four-player games are usually played in partnership; other numbers of players typically play for themselves.<br/><br/>In the original Scopa base game, four cards are turned face up on the table, and players are dealt hands of three cards.  On their turn, a player may capture any of the face-up cards on the table if the sum of the cards captured equals the value of the card played.  If a player cannot make a capture, they must discard a card face-up onto the table.  Cards are progressively handed out in lots of three until the deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, scoring is calculated.  Players earn 1 point for &quot;sweeping&quot; the table, that is, for clearing the table of all face-up cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards of the coin suit; 1 point for capturing the 7 of coins (the &quot;settebello&quot;); and 1 point for the best &quot;primiera,&quot; that is, the best assemblage of high-value cards from each of the four suits.<br/><br/>The game is traditionally played until a player or team reaches a set number of points, usually 11 or 21.<br/> The name &quot;Scopa&quot; means &quot;sweep&quot; or &quot;broom&quot; in Italian, and refers to the action of picking up all face-up cards on the table.<br/><br/>In some ways, Scopa can be thought of as a precursor to many popular modern game designs.

If you land on The Mask space, you place the mask piece over your playing piece (like a hood) and become The Mask. This gives you special powers including: the ability to ignore the die and move to the space you want, and ability to land on opponent's starting space and return a color chip back to the track. As soon as another player lands on the mask space, you have to remove the mask from your mover and give it to your opponent. The first player to collect and return all 4 missing items of his or her color wins.<br/><br/>",1994,,,

Cards are two-sided, one pink, one blue.  Cards are based on characters and monsters from the game.  There are &quot;levels&quot; of cards, each level containing monsters, guardian forces (summon monsters), or player characters (highest level).  Each player chooses a color.  Randomly determine who goes first.  Place a card on the grid.  Each card has a &quot;compass rose&quot; of 4 different numbers, 1-9, and then A representing 10.  Higher levels contain higher numbers.  If I place a card with the number 4 at it's north, and you place a card with a number 5 at it's south directly above mine, you &quot;flip&quot; mine, and both are now your color.

The reading player scores one point for each item that was not guessed, again plus three bonus points if the counter-marked item was not guessed.<br/><br/>The next player then takes the next category card, and the previous card reader re-joins the guessers.

(That is, if the 120 points split 42-34-25-19, it's best to be the '34' and worst to be the '42'.) Bonuses, known as Nil and Slam, are given respectively for taking no points or for taking 75+. Thus, almost any hand dealt has some strategy: few terrible hands exist.<br/><br/>Ambition is as much a game of players, and the interactions of their varying strategic objectives, as of cards.<br/><br/>For improvement's sake, the inventor has updated the game several times since its first publication in November 2003.

In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn.

Roll and move effect is mitigated in a number of ways - players can re-roll once in each turn and they can collect helping cards when arriving on specific spaces or rolling a pentagram. The four quests are as follows:<br/>- Library: find the book that opens a secret door to the secret passage. For this, find the same-colored book as the spaces you arrive on.<br/>- Maze: to find your way through the maze, move the 5 moving pentagon tiles showing parts of the maze. These can be moved (turned or moved to different spaces) when rolling a pentagram or when arriving on a pentagon space. Cards might also help.<br/>- Suspended bridge: each step (space) has some hidden traps that are revealed when stepping on them, easily causing players fall into the abyss. Some of them can be avoided with knowledge (knowing which blue owl has which number on its bottom), others with planning and luck (e.g. tiles where you fall into the abyss if you arrived there with specified die rolls), others with discarding a card. If a player falls into the abyss they have to climb back to the bridge and try again. The task gets easier once tiles are revealed and players know what to expect.<br/>- The Five Owls: owls have to be placed on the five numbered spaces in order (the owl with number 1 to space 1 and so on). If a player fails they go back to the entrance of the owls hall. The numbers on the bottom of the owls can be looked at during game (with cards or when rolling a pentagram) but whenever they are checked (secretly, by the active player) they are placed back to another space so their location keeps changing and players must watch their movement closely during the course of the game.<br/>The first player to correctly place the fifth owl to its corresponding place on the last space of the path wins.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

The other table, the &quot;Mobile Combat Results Table&quot; is a bloodless CRT, offering mostly retreat results.<br/><br/>Terrain varies from flat, open plains to some of the most rugged in the world.

The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.<br/><br/>As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.<br/><br/>This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower).

If any player finds he has a complete matching picture in his hand he can lay it down immediately, face upwards. Matching halves bear the same number.<br/>The player on the right of the dealer begins by laying one card down, face upwards. If the next player has the card to match it, he puts it down and takes the complete picture, counting it as a set in his favor. If he has not got the matching card he can put down any other card to make whatever funny combination he likes. However, only a &quot;top&quot; can be laid to a &quot;tail&quot;, or vice versa, as two tops or two tails cannot be put together. If a player has not the type of card required, he loses his turn to the next player. The winner is the player with most complete sets at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Rules for One Player:<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards well and lay them out face downwards in pairs, in such a way that the design on the backs of each pair forms a complete picture. Then turn the cards face upwards one by one. The resulting comical combinations will give a lot of amusement. If any of the pairs of cards you have laid out forms a matching pair (a set), place them on one side, face upwards, then shuffle the remaining cards and repeat the process until all the matching pairs have been found.<br/>You can take as long as an hour to play this game, and will always get different combinations.<br/><br/>",1964,,,

The goal is to be the first player to bring a certain number of barrels back to his home island. On a player's turn, he rolls three coloured dice. They decide how many islands further his boat may sail - but it's different than what many players are used to. If the player's own colour is rolled, then his movement is reduced by one. If he has barrels on board, then none of those colours may be rolled either. The more colourful the load, the greater the chance of not moving very far and losing the load instead.

Beginning in February, 1958 Castro began the first Guerrilla offensive by coming out of the Sierra Maesta Mountains and attacking the Bastiano troops in the plains. The Bastiano army counterattacked driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains beginning in June 1958. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the guerrillas, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Batista fled in January 1959, the guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was finally free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>The Cuban Revolution uses area movement and a simple and easy-to-learn combat system.

16496,Revolte in Rom,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Tags', 'Take That']","['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'Dice']","Rome is in a state of emergency, the Senate and the Guard are embroiled in fierce arguments, the people are divided. Many roads lead to Rome, whether you decide to use powerful cards such as the Tower and the Praetorian Guard to protect the power and victory points you have, or instead prefer to use the Consul and the Tribune to skilfully pull the strings behind the scenes. Whoever succeeds in using their connections and manages to play their cards cleverly will at the end deserve their victor's laurels.<br/><br/>Roma features unique card and dice play.  Players place cards at &quot;dice stations&quot; numbered 1-6.  The player uses dice rolled each turn to activate dice stations to use the card that has been placed at a station.  Card effects guide your tactical actions in the game through manipulating cards in play, providing money or granting victory points.<br/><br/>In each game of Roma, there are a fixed amount of victory points in play, once all victory points have been collected, the player who has the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Can be combined with its sequel game, Arena: Roma II, with varying play options.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/><br/>     Arena: Roma II<br/><br/><br/>",2005,,,
16497,Chilli Csali,"['Layering', 'Pattern Building', 'Take That', 'Tile Placement']","['Abstract Strategy', 'Print & Play']","Two spice dealers share a storehouse with a number of hungry rats, who want to put them out of business.  The two dealers want to store spices so that they know where everything is, but they also have to keep the rats at bay.  Stack your crates, keep your spices together, and cover up the rats.<br/><br/><br/>Rat Hot is a two-player game developed from Michael Schacht's Dschunke: Das Legespiel on his own label Spiel aus Timbuktu, which in turn was developed from his game Dschunke, also published by Queen. The Rat Hot tile distribution differs slightly from Dschunke: das Legespiel but you can very nearly use the Dschunke: das Legespiel rules with a Rat Hot set.<br/><br/>All the games use the clever mechanism of stacking long 3x1 tiles so that the upper tiles obscure some parts of the tiles underneath. In Rat Hot, the two players simply take turns to draw 2 tiles from a face down pile, and add them to the existing layout.<br/><br/>The tiles are all 1x3 and show a combination of rats, spices or empty crates. Each player has four different types of spice in their player colour which they are trying to form into large groups. Many of the tiles have spices of both colours.<br/><br/>The game is scored with grey and yellow chips which represent 1 and 2 points. Each time you place a tile, you and your opponent can score points from groups created or changed by that tile. Whenever a group of two of the same spice is formed, the owning player receives one point, or two points for groups of three or more. Beware! If there are three rats of your own colour visible at the end of your turn, you instantly lose.<br/><br/>When the draw pile is exhausted and the tiles all placed, the board is scored once more for all players, so trying to preserve existing groups also counts.<br/><br/>The real trick in the game comes in the tile placement. Tiles must be adjacent by at least one square. Tiles can placed on top of other tiles, so that stacks build up. But a tile can not sit exactly on top of another, so there must always be some offset, and all three squares of a tile must be supported by other tiles, or the table.<br/><br/>Rat Hot can be very tricky. You want to keep your opponent's rats exposed in awkward places, so they have to spend both their moves trying to keep the rats covered. But you also want to set up scoring positions, and cover your own rats, and avoid giving your opponent points as well. There's a good mental challenge here, as you puzzle over the best use and arrangement of your tiles. Do you dare leave two of your rats open, because your opponent may draw more of your rats and make it impossible for you to finish your next turn with less than three showing. Can you get a good group of spices going and also break up your opponent's groups? Tricky problems for tricky minds.<br/><br/>Rat Hot is a quick, fun game and is a good addition to Queen's line of small 2-player games. The wood chips make it easy to see who is leading, the tiles are nicely made, the graphics are fun, and the game plays quickly and fairly. You can be stuffed by unlucky tile draws, but perhaps your low score is more to do with your choices, or maybe the other player is just smarter than you. Fast play, easy rules, and the risk of sudden death give Rat Hot a high replay value.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

16500,Highland Clans,['Tile Placement'],"['Medieval', 'Territory Building']","Take charge of your clan from the Scottish high country. In each round, a player first builds up his clan and landholdings, and then optionally conducts a raid on an opponent.<br/><br/>You start by pulling six cubes from a bag. With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).<br/><br/>Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.<br/><br/>After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.<br/><br/>The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned. If the leading player has at least as many points as the number of the tile, the game ends.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a fast game offering something for everyone: luck, tactics, and lots of interaction with your fellow players.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

16512,4 X 4,"['Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']","['Abstract Strategy', 'Puzzle']","4x4 (aka Vier mal Vier) is an abstract 4-in-a-row variant in which 2 players use 16 grooved cubes to erect a wall between them, aiming to be the first one to create a sequence of 4 identical shapes in their own side of a wall, or of all 4 different ones. This row can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The cubical building bricks are all unique, come in 4 colours, and the only placement restriction is that each colour is only allowed once in each level or column. When the last brick is added, the completed wall will be 4x4.<br/><br/>On 2 opposing faces of each cube, a groove has been carved out. There are 4 distinct grooves, and the twist is that these grooves rarely mirror each other on either side of a cube. Therefor the wall face will look completely different to each player. The grooves are paired in such a way that within each group of 4 identically coloured cubes, only one cube has an identical shape on both sides (a different one for each colour). The other combinations are unique for that colour, and each combo occurs only one other time within the entire set.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the cubes are placed on coloured supply strips which show the 4 'footprints' of all the blocks that exist for each colour. The wall is build on the table surface between the players. Players can only see the top cube of each column and the shape of the groove on their side of the wall of the cubes below it. Forward planning, memory skills and deduction all come into play to some extent, as players above all need to prevent that the opponent gets the sequence of 4 first. The supply strips serve as gentle reminders of what is out there.<br/><br/>The pro-version introduces the rule that an opponent can force a player to take back the last played cube if it would prevent the wall from completion, and instead insist on the placement of a cube that would result in a wall with the maximum amount of bricks. It also suggest the removal of the reminder strips.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

A sixth set of cards (30 brewery cards) are comparable to the 'Chance' cards of Monopoly.<br/><br/>You roll the die to determine the number of steps you have to take (you can decide whether you travel clockwise or counter clockwise), and depending on the square you land upon, you need to answer a question or carry out an assignment, you can get to the next ring or you get to draw a 'Brewery' (Chance) card. If you answer a question correctly, you get a beer voucher, otherwise you have to pay a beer voucher. If one of the other players guesses your assignment correctly, both get a beer voucher.<br/><br/>There a two possibilities to get to the next ring: via an open door, or via a doorman. The doorman requires payment in the form of beer vouchers. When you reach the final ring, you need to have enough beer vouchers to pay your bill.

16756,Trampling Out the Vintage,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['American Civil War', 'Wargame']","From the publisher's webpage:<br/><br/>In 1864 General Sherman's march to Atlanta faced the heart of Dixie with the prospect of bloody fighting such as had already devastated large swathes of the Confederacy. And yet, despite a superiority in men and material, his task was a daunting one. Tied to the single-line of the Western and Atlantic Railroad for supply, and marching through a wilderness, Sherman could not afford to run up a huge butcher's bill. A too bloody summer's victory in Northern Georgia could easily result in a November defeat for President Lincoln in the forthcoming general election. On the other side General Johnston, commanding the defending Army of Tennessee, was no less vexed. He had attempted to whip his flagging forces into shape, despite sagging morale and a lack of reinforcements, but he knew this was a battle he could not afford to lose. Only reluctantly appointed to command by President Davis, Johnston would also be hamstrung by a divided and uncooperative staff.<br/><br/>Trampling out the Vintage is a simulation of the 1864 campaign for Atlanta. Both players maneuver and fight their units in an interactive sequence of play that places a premium on planning and decision making. Can you as General Sherman present the city of Atlanta to President Lincoln in a time and manner that will hasten the end of the war and ensure a second term for the Republican administration? Or, as General Johnston, can you stave off the Northern host and save the heartland of the Confederacy from capture and ruin?<br/><br/>",1999,,,

In this game, players use their favorite shamans to fight one-on-one duels in order to crown a Shaman King. It&rsquo;s fast-paced and furious fun!<br/><br/>The Shaman King TCG is kind of like the traditional card game War. Like War, Shaman King TCG players don&rsquo;t have a hand of cards. Instead, players take turns flipping cards from the top of their decks and comparing their attacks. The Shaman King TCG is also different than War. When you play War, you only have one chance to match or defeat your opponent&rsquo;s attack. In the Shaman King TCG, you have three chances, represented by the three colored zones. In War, cards are free to play, but in the Shaman King TCG, cards cost furyoku to play. Watch your furyoku carefully, and you&rsquo;ll be successful.<br/><br/>The Shaman King TCG is easy to learn. Players take turns attacking their opponents with strike cards while defending against their opponent&rsquo;s attacks at the same time. If your opponent fails to stop your strike in each of his or her three zones, you score a point. The first person to score three points wins the game.<br/><br/>Strikes aren&rsquo;t the only thing you need to win a shaman duel. Sneaky tactics, represented by advantage cards, and help from one&rsquo;s friends, represented by teamwork cards, will mean the difference between winning and losing the game.<br/><br/>Each shaman also has a different set of signature moves that you can find on the special pull-out card inside the Shaman Chamber CardTM. These represent each shaman&rsquo;s powerful attacks and may only be played under certain conditions.&quot;<br/><br/>",2004,,,

If that's not enough, there's also the danger of being 'bumped' by other players!<br/><br/>&quot;COLOPTION can be played by two to six players which immediately makes it more sociable than backgammon which is played as a twosome. A round is over when all of one player's men have either reached the goal or been bumped. A round usually lasts from fifteen to thirty minutes. Play can be for several rounds as in backgammon or for point totals as in bridge.&quot;<br/><br/>",1978,,,

Along the way, they face state fines and maintenance issues for their car. The game ends when a player reaches their service station, but the winner is the player with the most money at the end.<br/><br/>",1980,,,
16890,Containment,"['Dice Rolling', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Environmental'],"&quot;Containment&quot; is a game played between pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear factions. Pro-nuclear players try to go &quot;on line&quot; and produce electricity; anti-nuclear players try to shut down the reactor and switch to alternate forms of energy production. A reactor in the center of the board moves either towards or away from meltdown as the game progresses, depending on the players' actions.<br/><br/>&quot;Containment&quot; may be played on three levels: a Basic game that is purely luck driven, a Standard game that uses arguments and counterarguments (given on the game board) in the nuclear power debate to influence game play, and an Advanced game that calls on the players to evaluate and rank their own arguments as well as those of their opponents.<br/><br/>The game is obviously inspired by the events at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, as one of the arguments given on the game board explicitly mentions TMI. The box cover artwork is also very evocative of TMI.<br/><br/>",1979,,,
16891,Corvette,"['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Transportation'],"&quot;Corvette&quot; bills itself as &quot;the automobile maintenance and trading game.&quot; However, it somehow feels more like a Chevy advertising piece, as each player progresses from owning a Cavalier through a Celebrity, Caprice, and Camaro in their quest to be the first to own a Corvette and be free of debt.<br/><br/>2-6 players compete in an admittedly simplistic game: collect money by passing &quot;payday&quot;, then hope to avoid spending it all on car maintenance in order to buy a better car. Judicious selection of which &quot;pick up&quot; cards (coupons and special board advance cards) to keep in one's hand add a little strategy to an otherwise &quot;roll and move&quot; style game.<br/><br/>",1985,,,
16892,Counter All Terrorists!,['Trick-taking'],"['Card Game', 'Spies/Secret Agents']","&quot;Counter All Terrorists&quot; challenges its players to defend against a series of terrorist attacks on the United States. The game may be played solitaire, or by up to six players. As the title suggests, the object is to counter terrorists' attacks on the &quot;White House, Pentagon, CIA, FBI, Air Force One, and many military bases and cities across the United States.&quot;<br/><br/>It is an unusual title in terms of historical insight, having been published in 1986 and embellishing its instructions with Albert Einstein's quote, &quot;imagination is more important than knowledge.&quot; The game treats a subject that few would take seriously at the time -- though, in hindsight, its designers also failed in imagination for the weights given the various terror targets.<br/><br/>",1986,,,

Players use jets, ships, amphibious vehicles, and rockets to seize an enemy goal square or eliminate their opponent.<br/><br/>The map for at least one printing is a bit of a curiosity. In it, the cover of the box shows a 10x10 board with alternating green and blue squares. The instructions note that the land squares are green and the sea squares are blue. However, the actual map provided is 10x16, has only black and white print on yellow paper, and uses the letters &quot;L&quot; and &quot;S&quot; to designate land and sea spaces. It would appear that the designer assumed he would be able to print color boards, but then had to fall back to a simpler black and white drawing printed on yellow paper.<br/><br/>",1973,,,
16897,Game of Love,['Point to Point Movement'],['Humor'],"In this game, two to eight players compete by trying to out-romance each other. For the winner, the game notes, &quot;Your reward is collecting a KISS, a BEAR HUG, or a HEARTY HANDSHAKE from the lover of your choice. (We suggest the winning lover and the chosen one leave the room for this.)&quot;<br/><br/>While luck plays a factor in moving from the start space to the LOVE NEST goal, life experiences, memory, quick wit, and other factors can also help you advance. Some spaces call upon you to quote a line from a love poem (or complete a line for a provided rhyme) without repeating another player's answer. Others call on a player to correctly identify the eye color of the other players in the game. Still others feature bits along the line, &quot;If you think your legs are pretty, go forward one. If anyone doubts you, prove it or go back two.&quot;<br/><br/>",1965,,,
16898,Hat In The Ring,"['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting']",['Political'],"&quot;Hat in the Ring&quot; is a throwback to an era when political party conventions still were perceived to hold an important role in the nomination of each party's candidates.<br/><br/>In this game, three to eight players compete for their party's nomination; however, in a classroom setting, additional roles such as Campaign Manager, Treasurer, etc. may be assigned to other participants. Players go through a series of primaries, then try to gain the required number of delegates at their party's convention to win on a given ballot. Delegates are won in blocks of 10; a player must therefore claim at least 660 out of the 1,300 delegates to win a given ballot and claim the nomination.<br/><br/>",1971,,,

THE CATHOLIC NOSTALGIA GAME&quot; offers 2-6 players the opportunity to test themselves (in a somewhat humorous vein) on pre Vatican II Catholic doctrine.<br/><br/>While it can be played as a trivia game by non-Catholics, a handicap is definitely in order if one of the players is Catholic... and, especially, an older practicing Catholic.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to ascend the Papal throne by completing &quot;a six-decade rosary&quot; around the board and advancing through the Church hierarchy.<br/><br/>",1986,,,
16900,Longball,"['Dice Rolling', 'Simulation']",['Sports'],"&quot;Longball&quot; is a stats-driven baseball simulation in which the players draw up their lineups from contemporary (to the publication date) Major League players, then play out the game with those players' stats weighting each die roll result.<br/><br/>At least three different editions of Longball were released. The first edition was in 1975 by Ashburn Industries and offered cards based on the 1974 season and projected 1975 rookies.  The second edition was in 1977 by Skor-Mor, and offered individual cards to represent each major league player's stats. The third was in 1979 by Ashburn Industries, which consolidated the player stats into 13 double-sided Team Roster cards.<br/><br/>The 1979 edition of Longball offers two levels of game play: the &quot;Master&quot; Game, an Advanced &quot;Master&quot; Game, and the Basic Game. Curiously, Ashburn gives the rules for the Basic Game last, reasoning, &quot;Since the majority of the people who buy LONGBALL buy it for the ultimate in baseball accuracy, we will begin with the explanation of the Advanced 'Master' version.&quot;<br/><br/>",1975,,,
16901,Lyle's Baseball Game,"['Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement']",['Sports'],"In 1991, Sheryl and Steve Shrout took one of Steve's old game ideas and worked it into an actual game product. The game, &quot;Lyle's Baseball Game&quot;, draws its identity from Steve Shrout's middle name. It may be played solo or with two players. While the game is essentially a dice rolling contest, there are some amusing rules tossed in:<br/><br/>- No kicking dirt onto home plate.<br/>- No spitting on the field.<br/>- All rolls of the dice are final. No arguing with the dice.<br/>- Seventh inning stretch optional, but suggested for couch potatoes.<br/><br/>",1991,,,
16902,Megacorp,"['Hand Management', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Economic'],"In a manner slightly reminiscent of Milton Bradley's game of &quot;Life&quot;, two to six players choose whether to follow a path of self-employment and eventual sellout to Megacorp, or a university program that leads them to employment with Megacorp. However, both paths eventually converge and lead the players onto the path of a corporate takeover. When all players have reached either the &quot;Pyramid&quot; or the &quot;Over Budget&quot; squares, the player with the greatest total of Common Stock Shares becomes the Chief Executive Officer of Megacorp and wins the game.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

The first player to return home with the required six sacraments and at least 700 merit points after the six properties are built wins the game.<br/><br/>The question deck is filled with excellent questions related to Catholic belief and practice, and also has cards that offer the player a chance to advance via deeds rather than answers (e.g., a card that allows the player to go to any square if they promise to say the rosary, or pray a Hail Mary, and so on).<br/><br/>",1962,,,
16904,BP Offshore Oil Strike: Europe,"['Commodity Speculation', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Economic'],"Two to four players compete at exploring for oil, building platforms, and laying pipelines to bring the offshore oil back to the player's home company. Players take on the roles of either BP (Hull), Amoco (Bergen), Chevron (Rotterdam) or Mobil (Dieppe) in their quest for oil. As with other games focusing on offshore oil exploitation (e.g., Omnia's North Sea Oil), there is also the risk that storms will reduce production on, or eliminate, one's oil platforms. The first player to make $120,000,000 in cash is the winner.<br/><br/>",1973,,,

16907,Pol-A-Tics,"['Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Political'],"In &quot;Pol-A-Tics&quot;, each player is assigned a platform of seven different issues that shows which position their candidate has taken on each issue. As with many election games, players choose a game duration prior to the start of game play. When that time has expired, players determine the popular vote winner in each state to allocate the electoral votes. Unlike actual elections, however, a tie in the popular vote for a state results in a split of that state's electoral votes, and the player with the most electoral votes is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",1959,,,
16908,Politics As Usual,"['Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Political'],"In &quot;Politics as Usual&quot;, each player takes on the role of a U.S. Senator and competes at getting himself/herself re-elected to the Senate. A player needs 5,000,000 votes in order to be re-elected. To gain these votes, players will need to cooperate with each other to pass Pork Barrel legislation and gain voter support, as well as work on their own to raise money.<br/><br/>The box cover illustrates some of the rather humorous cards in the game, some of which play off of events contemporaneous to the game's design. In one example, a player gains 700,000 votes due to their &quot;Trial Reform&quot; bill which, in actuality, creates a casino in the player's state &quot;specializing in bets on outcomes of celebrity murder trials.&quot;<br/><br/>",1996,,,

In this game, 2-6 players race to the Pearly Gates. However, instead of amassing virtues - or even converts - the victor must acquire sufficient money and possessions in order to win.<br/><br/>Includes 6 playing pieces, one die, 6 different denominations of money ($5,000 to $500,000), 3 types of cards (possession, contribution and expense), instructions and fold out board (14&quot; X 19.5&quot;).<br/><br/>",1987,,,
16910,Presidential Fever,"['Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Political'],"&quot;Presidential Fever&quot; allows players to face off against each other in a two Party contest. Two to four players may compete, though the three player game essentially calls for one player on one side to fill both the Presidential and Vice-Presidential roles. Players move around the board, capturing states with campaign funds. Players must also watch to maintain their credibility rating and to build either a liberal or conservative rating when appropriate. A lack of credibility keeps your party from winning a state; high credibility allows your party to overcome a liberal or conservative bias; liberal or conservative leanings provide financial rewards in many states.<br/><br/>Unlike most games based on the Electoral College system, Presidential Fever combines a number of contiguous low value states into a single region (e.g., Farm Belt, Border States, Mid-Atlantic, Deep South, etc.).<br/><br/>",1979,,,
16911,Profit & Loss,"['Commodity Speculation', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Economic'],"Now here's a game from 1977 with a relatively short title and a mouthful of a game maker's name. The game is Profit &amp; Loss ; the maker is Hollow Stump Bungalow Books &amp; Games.<br/><br/>As the name suggests, two to six players buy and sell various items (antiques, art, securities, real estate, collectibles, etc.), trying to achieve a profit on each one. However, victory goes to the first player to reach $1,000,000, so at the end of the game it may be worthwhile to dump items at a loss to reach the finish first.<br/><br/>",1977,,,

The object of the game is to amass the greatest wealth through property ownership. Players first compete at auction for the properties, then collect rents from each other or the bank as they land on owned properties.

16913,Running For President,"['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Political'],"&quot;Running For President&quot; is a game that provides an odd mix of Primary, Convention, and General Election campaigns. Each player must obtain the necessary vote total in the Primary area in order to proceed to the Convention, then a higher vote total to proceed to the General Election, then a still higher vote total to break free and try to end the game.

If sounds come from the speaker, the corresponding room is blocked to that player.<br/><br/>",1988,,,
16915,Slick Willie,"['Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Political'],"Long before Monica Lewinsky and cigars came to the fore on Clinton-based games, &quot;Slick Willie&quot; was a common theme in the Clinton-based game fare. As the designer goes on to note in his introduction, &quot;This game is based solely on my opinion. It's designed to make you laugh at all the hard times we've had over taxation and for all the aggravation, desperation and suffering we're all going to share in the months and years ahead.&quot;<br/><br/>In light of the game having come out before Clinton finished his first year in office, the prior 12 years of Republican presidencies, and the subsequent U.S. economic boom, it comes across in hindsight as one of the more mean-spirited Clinton games to hit the market.<br/><br/>The game is nominally for two to four players, though the designer notes that, &quot;you may play up to 6 players, for extra pawns use lose [sic] change.&quot; The object of the game is to amass and retain 270 electoral votes while trying to enter the White House.<br/><br/>",1993,,,

In a fashion reminiscent of Monopoly, players gain the electoral votes of a given state by landing on it and buying it.

16920,The Narc Game,"['Open Drafting', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Humor'],"&quot;The Narc Game&quot; strikes an unusual, and perhaps unintentional, balance between the blatantly drug-sympathetic &quot;Dealer McDope&quot; and the &quot;just say no&quot; approach of &quot;Decisions&quot;. From the lid description above, it would appear to be a strictly anti-drug game. Yet, curiously, actual game play comes across more as a &quot;beat the system&quot; game than one of social value education.<br/><br/>Two to six players compete, with the object of the game being to accumulate the fewest arrests. The game ends when all players have successfully made it from the &quot;START&quot; square to the &quot;HOME&quot; square. Along the way, players gain and lose money in various drug deals, and must try to avoid a stint in the Criminal Justice system that costs them money and sends them back to &quot;START&quot;.<br/><br/>The joke of the game, of course, is that it is almost impossible to go from START to HOME without getting sent back to START.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

Three other pieces on each side represent Earth's Moon and its orbital nodes.  The pieces are made of a plastic called Tenite (according to the rulebook) and resemble chess pieces topped with the traditional planetary symbols.<br/><br/>The pieces have movement powers reminiscent of those of chess pieces, but with some differences: several pieces have more than one way to move, one mode of movement - N squares at a time in any direction, repeated 3 times - is not found in standard chess, and generally speaking pieces are limited to moving a number of spaces equal to their relative position from the Sun plus 1 (e.g., the Earth piece can move 4 squares at a time).<br/><br/>The board is a 20x20 grid with a block of 40 unplayable spaces in the center.  There are special starred spaces on the board which are used by the pieces with weaker standard movement (Mercury and Helios) to teleport around the board.<br/><br/>Pieces are captured by landing on them.

The premise is that the players are trying to get the landlord's attention by plugging up the toilet in their apartment with anything they can find on the theory that, while the toilet is being fixed all the other things wrong with the apartment will be fixed also.  Having lived in off-campus apartments during college, I can relate.<br/><br/>Each player is given a playing mat with a picture of a toilet on it and is dealt one card.  On each player's turn they may draw from 0-2 cards and play one card, either on their own toilet or another player's.  The winner is the first person to exactly reach a predetermined level of points worth of stuff in their toilet (20 points for a two player game, 18 for three, etc.)  Some cards are worth negative points and are played on opponents.  That person must then remove that many points worth of stuff from their toilet.  If they don't have any cards small enough (say a -2 card was played, for instance) they must discard a larger card (Baby Brother [+5] for instance) and accept the greater loss--no making change allowed.  There are also Pet cards.  While a player has a Pet card next to their toilet they cannot win even if their toilet is full to the required score--the landlord doesn't allow pets.  They may discard the Pet card, but this counts as their entire action for the turn and they may not draw or play any other cards.<br/><br/>Each copy of Super Plug also comes with 5 blank cards.  Players are encouraged to create cards of their own.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

Players use their controlled credit each turn to build or upgrade their ships.<br/>Ships have two characteristics, movement speed and combat strength - players choose the values of these by how much they spend.<br/><br/>Interest is added by the technological advances which can be purchased.  Some of these are permanent, such as Hyperdrive, which lets one ship per turn move an unlimited distance, or Capture, which lets you capture enemy ships if you have a 3:1 advantage, while some are temporary, such as Force Field, which protects a system for one turn.  (Capture will sound familiar to players of Flying Buffalo's Starweb play-by-mail game - most of the Starweb abilities are in fact reproduced here.)

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Opening the shutter at this point reveals a &quot;light&quot; that tells how many spaces the ship may move.<br/><br/>Some strategy comes into play, as circle spaces at the board's pathway intersections confer both advantages and disadvantages.

The board is a long plastic tray flanked with colorful western town inserts. At each end of the tray is a plastic six-shooter (one for each player) that are attached so that they can move freely across the width of the board. The guns are loaded with ball bearings on the top. A slide comes out the bottom and ends flush with the playing surface where a plastic cowboy is attached. When you pull the trigger, a ball rolls down the slide, goes through the legs of the cowboy and shoots across the tray toward your opponent's side. Each plastic cowboy has a tab by its feet that acts as a target. Hit it with a &quot;bullet&quot; and the cowboy gets knock down &quot;dead&quot;. The fist player to shoot the other player's cowboy wins. Each player has a rock and a cactus to use as cover.

16985,Gelb gewinnt!,[],['Card Game'],"Gelb gewinnt! is based on the Italian game Scopa; Kosmos described it as Scopa in German style.<br/><br/>The game consists of two deck of cards, each consisting of 10 yellow cards and 30 blue cards, valued 1-10. In addition, 80 victory point chips are included.<br/><br/>Each round is played as follows: the dealer will deal each player three cards. Four cards are played on the table, open. The players now take turns playing cards. On each turn, a player can play exactly one card. A player can use this card to capture a number of cards on the table. Cards can be captured if the sum of those cards is equal to the card played (i.e. you can capture a six and a two by playing an eight). If a player cannot capture any cards, he has to add a card to those open on the table. A player gets one point for capturing all cards on the table.<br/><br/>The round lasts until all players have played their three hand cards. Now, each player receives points: One point for the player who has captured the yellow seven, one point for the player who has captured the most yellow cards and one point for the player who has captured the most cards.<br/><br/>The play continues for a couple of rounds (either six rounds for two or three players, or a number of rounds equal to the number of players if there are four or more players.

At the start of play, each player places their pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.<br/><br/>Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.<br/><br/>2015 edition:<br/>The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem.

16992,Tsuro,"['Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Player Elimination', 'Tile Placement']","['Abstract Strategy', 'Fantasy']","From the publisher:<br/><br/>A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/><br/>Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.<br/><br/>This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

The first to succeed, wins the game.<br/><br/>Quick game overview:<br/>On their turn, players throw the dice and, depending on the color of the dot, act out their options.<br/>- Getting a green dot allows the player take two action. They can move their train either 1 or 2 steps, each step counting as 1 action. They can also turn the train around, which also costs 1 action. A green dot can therefor be used for: 2 steps OR 1 turn + 1 step (making the turn first). After moving their train, players must draw an action card and do what it says. After this, the turn passes to the next player.<br/>- Getting a red dot stop the player from both moving and turning, they also cannot draw an action card. Instead, a player throwing a red dot may draw an obstruction card. They may either play it immediately, or keep it for later. However, any one player may only have up to 3 obstruction cards. Throwing a red dot and having 3 obstruction cards already means drawing a new card and performing one of the four cards.<br/><br/>Game setup:<br/>All city markers are placed on the cities with their corresponding names. The decks of city cards and obstruction cards are each shuffled. All players draw one card from the city deck and take the corresponding marker from the board, thus having collected 1 of the 6 different colors, needing to collect only 5 more.<br/><br/>",2003,,,

17015,The Original Intersection,['Roll / Spin and Move'],['Dice'],"&quot;The Original Intersection TM&quot; is the humorously intended title of a game that owes almost all of its creative inspiration to Parcheesi, the Westernized version itself of Pachisi.  The designers are simply experimenting to see how little they have to change to come up with their own game that will make them a million dollars in royalties, (or at least a tidy income so they can design MORE games without otherwise having to work) and thus, avoiding copyright infringement lawsuits.  As such, it IS a useful and instructive game, as it is almost certain that they would have made more money had they simply reproduced the original public domain version and sold it.<br/><br/>The game differs from Parcheesi in that it has a jazzier layout, where the players move in a more complicated journey around a mazelike path of concentric circles.  An additional option is the ability to play as a &quot;partner&quot; with other players, moving your partner's  pieces once yours are all safely &quot;home&quot;.<br/><br/>Though the board itself IS reasonably attractive, this is purely a &quot;novelty&quot; game, purchased for no other reason than that probably nobody else had ever seen it.  It is one step away from a total &quot;home production&quot;, in that the parts are made nearly as cheaply as possible.

All players move (using jumpacs for extra speed), then all units fire, with the latter normally being simultaneous.  Roll to hit - on a successful hit, you inflict damage, generally by chipping away at the opponent's armor and wound totals.  Heavy weapons will generally vaporize a target in one hit and have enormous ranges - consequently they dominate the game.

Their code of honor forced them to fight at the level of their intended victims, and they turned to the New Jersey media to determine what that level should be. Luckily, the Krylons&rsquo; cable TV had been cut off due to a billing error; they could only get one channel on their TV sets, and that channel was running a barbarian-movie festival that day.

17076,Dead Slug,['Dice Rolling'],['Dice'],"In Dead Slug, players roll five six-sided dice and, if they can build certain shapes, continue to roll and accumulate points. It plays very much like many bar room dice games.<br/><br/>You need two+ players, five six-sided dice, and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll all five dice. Pull aside only the highest dice rolled (including doubles), AND any &lsquo;attached&rsquo; dice. An attached die is one that is sequenced one number lower than the high die (or dice). Ex: rolling two 6&rsquo;s, a 5, and three 2&rsquo;s, only the 6&rsquo;s and the 5 are pulled aside. Rolling a 4 and four 1&rsquo;s, only the 4 is pulled. Note that 1 has no lower attached dice (just as you can&rsquo;t roll higher than a 6).<br/><br/>These &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; dice occupy imaginary tiers in a &lsquo;shape matrix&rsquo; (see completed shapes in the image section). Whatever your highest die is (or dice are), place it (or them) into the topmost tier of what will become your shape (if completed), and place any attached dice in the next tiers down. Ex: rolling a 6, two 5&rsquo;s, a 2, and a 1, the 6 and the 5&rsquo;s are pulled into the top two tiers (the roller is on her way to several possible shapes&mdash;Praying Mantis, Snowman, etc.).<br/><br/>Pick up any dice that aren&rsquo;t pulled into the shape matrix and roll them again. The tier system continues, as long as the roller has thrown any &lsquo;attached&rsquo; dice that would occupy the next lowest tier. Only the lowest filled tier is considered &lsquo;open&rsquo; for attached dice, in that you can match the number occupying that lowest tier (in addition to rolling the next lowest number). Ex: the first roll &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; three 5&rsquo;s, which all occupy the top tier (possible shapes include Little T, Beret, Dead Slug, etc.) &ndash; the other dice (we&rsquo;ll say a 2 and a 1) are picked back up and re-rolled. Second roll: another 5 and a 6 (the 6 cannot be placed above the 5 and will be re-rolled); the 5 is pulled alongside the existing 5&rsquo;s (roller is on his way to a Dead Slug or a Beret). Third roll gets a 1. The roller&rsquo;s turn ends and the dice are passed to the next player. Had the roller gotten another 5 or a 4, a shape would have been created and the roller would receive the appropriate points and would be &lsquo;still rolling&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Keep rolling, as long as at least one die can be pulled (from each subsequent roll) and played legally. Only if a shape is completed: players may decide to stop and score the points for the shape, OR roll all five dice again, continuing to accumulate points. If a player ever decides to keep rolling and is unable to complete a shape in subsequent rolls, that player &lsquo;bombs out&rsquo; and scores zero points. A player must accumulate at least 2,000 consecutive points before &lsquo;being on the board&rsquo; for the first time only.

The rules give 5 variations of play, such as simply drawing one card and playing it, or drawing two, choosing one to play on your side and giving your opponent the other and so on. A die is rolled to determine how each hand will be played. The game is played in 3 rounds, and 3-5 cards are turned up at the start of each round and get $200 in chips placed on them. Players take turns to lay up to 4 more cards on their side, to make the best 5 card hand they can. In this way, the original face-up card on each row is shared by the players, and you can easily see what you need to play to beat your opponent's hand.<br/><br/>When the rows are complete, the player who has the winning hand on each row takes the chips in the middle. After playing the simple version, players can then use the betting rules, which let them raise the betting on the center cards. This makes the game more tense and more fun as the stakes are raised. Can you play the right card to beat your opponent and win $100s?<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Head-to-Head Poker Game Parker Brothers and Hasbro Games.<br/>Build the best hand in this poker duel!

The defender (player who did not select the final contract) must then (a) announce his intention to play a Nullo contract; or (b) declare his honor-meld, if any, against declarer's contract; or (c) pass. Declarer must then (a) bid a Slam or (b) pass. In either case, Dealer declares his honor-meld, if any. A slam bid will void any Nullo contact. Honor-melds are first declared by their point value; and the winning meld (see table) is shown and then scored. If played at the turned trump, that card may be taken in exchange for the seven of trumps.<br/><br/>THE PLAY: Defender leads first; he may lead any card. The other player must follow suit, if able; if she cannot follow suit, she must trump, if able. A trump led must be won, if possible. After the first trick, the winner of a trick leads to the next. In the trump suit, if any, the cards rank J,9,A,10,K,Q,8,7.  In any other suit the cards rank A,10,K,Q,J, 9,8,7. A Nullo contract is always played without a trump suit.<br/><br/>THE SCORING: Any winning meld is scored to the holder's credit in his honor column (above the line). Each player adds his trick score and honor score (including bonuses if any). Each player adds his trick score and honor score. If declarer has the higher total, he scores his trick score toward game (below the line) while the defender scores his trick score above the line. If the defender has the higher total, he adds declarer's trick score to his own, and scores the total below the line. On any doubled contract, the player with the higher total receives the combined trick scores, at twice their value, below the line. A game ends when a player scores 80 points or more below the line. A rubber ends when one player has won two games. When declarer and defender have the same total; or when a Nullo contract is played, the combined trick score is held aside and awarded above the line to the player who ahs the  higher total score on the succeeding hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         CARD POINTS<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Jack of Trumps<br/><br/>         20<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Nine of trumps<br/><br/>         15<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any ace<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any Ten<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any King<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any Queen<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Last Trick*<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Jo-Jotte**<br/><br/>         20<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Except at Nullos<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Jo-Jotte is K and Q of trump suit, if any.

Uncommon Valor ATS Upgrade,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Wargame', 'World War II']","From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>MOTOYAMA AIRFIELD #2, Iwo Jima, 27 February 1945: The Marines of Colonel Kenyon&rsquo;s 9th Marine Regiment had a rough time during their first day in the line, 26 February. They had made two determined assaults on &lsquo;Hill Peter&rsquo;, to no avail. After reorganizing during the night, the 9th Marines were ready for another push to the top of the hill. At 1250 hrs., their break came. Following a ten minute preparation by division and corps artillery, both battalions struck out in a coordinated attack. With the 1st Battalion on the right and the 2nd on the left, the Marines began their move up the slopes of Hill Peter. The 1st Battalion overran the hill and continued on down the reverse slope and up to the crest of &lsquo;Hill Oboe&rsquo; to the northwest. The 1st Battalion&rsquo;s &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company did not enjoy the same momentum on their way to Oboe. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company was stopped by a small enemy AA detachment with supporting fire from emplaced machine-guns in a small draw on their right flank. &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company rapidly deployed to meet this threat.<br/><br/>ATS SEMPER FI! (aka Uncommon Valor Upgrade Edition) is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Iwo Jima. Three years into the Pacific war the United States Marine Corps had mastered the art of the amphibious landing. The landing force at Iwo still had much to learn about the enemy. Senior intelligence officers did not know until 27 February that General Kuribayashi was in fact personally running the show from his headquarters on Iwo Jima. As the Marines regrouped after their landing, it was obvious that something was different on Iwo Jima. No dense jungles, just ash from the island&rsquo;s volcano, Suribachi. Steam could be seen rising from the natural sulfur water wells which bubbled to the surface all over the island. Worse, the dug-in defenders actually numbered half again the original estimate of 13,000. Kuribayshi was particularly pleased with the quality of his artillery and engineering troops. The Japanese defenders waiting for the advance of the V Amphibious Corps were well armed and confident. The game depicts the confrontation at Motoyama Airfield #2, a war waged with the most vicious weapons available to the combatants, including flame-throwing &lsquo;Zippo&rsquo; Shermans and Japanese heavy artillery. Everything is included to play!.<br/>&middot;    A collection of 517 color, die-cut counters representing the USMC and Japanese combatants that fought in the battle; <br/>&middot;    Six scenarios, ranging from small to large, that all play on the historical map; <br/>&middot;    A 22 x 34 color map of the Motoyama #2 battlefield on heavyweight stock; <br/>&middot;    A complete ATS system rulebook tailored specifically to the game; <br/>&middot;    Six Play Aid Cards; <br/>&middot;    Battlefield Walk around and Special Rules document (an ATS specialty!) <br/>&middot;    A color cover sheet (perfect for your rules binder) and a snazzy ziploc bag to hold it all.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

At 1350 hours the company commander, Captain George R. J. Weigand, was ordered to move up between the two ridges, then turn left, using Fox Ridge as cover. The goal of the onslaught was Ryan&rsquo;s Ridge, or alternately the road cut west of Gusukuma. It was still assumed at that point that contact could be established with 1st Battalion. Weigand completed passing through Ryan&rsquo;s left flank and attacked east toward the crest of Ryan&rsquo;s Ridge, heading toward what the Company Commander thought would be a covered route to the top of the ridge. Weigand attacked in platoons, moving to the point with 3rd Platoon, under command of Technical Sergeant Ernest L. Shoeff. This platoon would find itself attacking alone, after a storm of enemy machine-gun and mortar fire forced the rest of the company to ground. Weigand, Shoeff, and two squads kept moving forward, using tombs at the foot of the hill for cover. Orders were communicated to Weigand by a runner: extend the line at all costs. The Captain and two men soon found themselves cut off from Shoeff and the remainder of the main body. For the rest of the afternoon the company commander was under constant fire and out of communications with everyone. After dark Weigand managed to make his way back to Fox Ridge and rejoin his company. His uniform was shot full of holes but Weigand returned uninjured.<br/><br/>ATS BLOOD &amp; IRON is the new COMPLETE GAME that depicts the battle for Okinawa. The center of the Japanese resistance in the area lay in the &ldquo;I&rdquo; section of Target Area 7777, which came to be called &ldquo;Item Pocket&rdquo;&mdash;in military terminology I is called Item. The pocket was the hub of the enemy position; from it, like spokes on a giant wheel, extended four low ridges, separated from each other by ravines and rice paddies. Potter&rsquo;s Ridge ran north from the hub, Charlie Ridge to the northeast, Gusukuma Ridge to the southeast, and Ryan Ridge to the southwest. Lying between Gusukuma and Charlie Ridges and sloping to the east was a cone-shaped hill called by the Americans &ldquo;Brewer&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo; A gulch ran along each side of the hill&mdash;Anderson&rsquo;s Gulch on the north and Dead Horse Gulch on the south. Both ran in an easterly direction, crossing Route 1 at small bridges just north of Gusukuma. The ground was superbly suited for active defense. Typical Japanese positions were connected by tunnels along the sides and under the crests of the ridges; Ryan Ridge, in particular, was honeycombed with such defenses. From Item Pocket the enemy had excellent command both of the coastal areas to the north and west and the open land to the east where Route 1 ran north-south. The Japanese had long been aware of the defensive value of this position against either a beach landing on the northwest or an attack from the north. Months before the Americans landed, Japanese troops and Okinawan laborers were boring tunnels and establishing elaborate living quarters and aid stations. The area was held by two companies of the 21st Independent Infantry Battalion of the 64th Brigade, 62nd Division, supported by an antitank company, a machine gun company, and elements of antiaircraft, artillery, and mortar units. At least 600 Japanese occupied the Pocket, reinforced by several hundred Okinawans. <br/>&middot; A collection of 517 color, die-cut counters representing the US Army and Japanese combatants that fought in the battle; <br/>&middot; SIX scenarios, ranging in size from small to large, that play on the historical map; <br/>&middot; A 22 x 34 color map of the ITEM POCKET battlefield on heavyweight stock; <br/>&middot; A complete ATS system rulebook tailored specifically to the game; <br/>&middot; Six Play Aid Cards; <br/>&middot; Battlefield Walkaround and Special Rules document (an ATS specialty!) <br/>&middot; A color cover (perfect for your rules binder) and a snazzy ziplock bag to hold it all.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Each map tile is made of one hexagon surrounded by six hexagons. Each tile will have a mixture of any or all of five types of terrain: grasslands, farmlands, mountains, woods, and hills. Each player gets a Player Aid card, selects a color of people tokens and places the era cube of the matching color on The Era Starting Box on the Progress Column part of the game board. A starting player is selected. Some tiles are placed contiguously on the game board (the number of tiles depends on the number of players) one at a time in turn order.

The game is now ready to begin.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>Players should note which terrain will be worth Progress Points at the end of the era.

For example, chips with the Taunt ability force attacking chips to attack them before any other chips. Chips are eliminated from the play area as play continues. After throwing and playing out all their chips, players count all their Clout still in the play area plus extra points for proximity to other chips.

Collect, win, lose or buy LOVE, MONEY, PEOPLE and Question cards in this fun and exciting game where all players win a real personalized fortune card reading of their own.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Each player rolls the die, moves his or her pawn, and then does what the landed on square tells them to.

The rules state that the &quot;object is for each player to collect as many fortune telling cards as possible&quot;; but they also state that the winner &quot;is the player who draws the last card,&quot; which ends the game and allows that player to discard up to three of their cards.<br/><br/>The real purpose is for each player to use the cards collected during the game to have their personal fortune told on the tarot-style card layout board.<br/><br/>If you believe in this stuff, you'll be happy to know that &quot;all Jennifer Sands products are created with the assistance of professional psychics, fortune tellers and astrologers.

Place wooden guards on the clover tiles and two of the positive tiles as indicated in the rules. Each player has three tokens (two in a five- or six-player game) that start at the beginning of the path.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the die, then move one of your tokens that many spaces down the path. If your token is the only one on a tile when you leave it, you collect that tile, which shrinks the path on which everyone is moving. If a guard is still on a tile when you leave it, you do not collect the tile. If any player's token is on the same space as a guard, you can move that guard instead of moving one of your own tokens, possibly setting someone else up for misfortune on a future turn and possibly setting yourself up for goods things &mdash; as long as no one else lands on your tile!<br/><br/>Once your token reaches the final space on the path, that token is retired from play. Once all tokens are retired, players tally their points, with each clover you possess turning a negative tile into a positive one. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Verflixxt! includes a number of variants, including one in which you construct the path by laying out the tiles at random instead of in a particular order. The 2020 version of Verflixxt! uses this variant for its basic set-up, with the addition of a double-sided &quot;give/steal&quot; tile placed after every eighth tile on the path. When you collect tiles in this version of play, you place them in a tower, with your most recently collected tile on top. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;give&quot; tile, you must give your topmost tile to another player, giving a negative token to whoever has the most positive token on top and vice versa; you then flip the &quot;give&quot; tile to its &quot;steal&quot; side. When you are the last token to leave a &quot;steal&quot; tile, you take the topmost tile from whichever player you choose, then place it on top of your stack.<br/><br/>For an even trickier variant, you can play that the clover tile affects only the tile directly beneath it in your stack, turning a positive negative and a negative positive. Now the clover isn't always so attractive!<br/><br/>",2005,,,

To begin, kids select how many points each squad should start out with, pick their squads and put them into formation.  On each turn, kids will move their figures across the table (counting distance using a patented clicking wheel in the base), and then attack with features like slashing light sabers, firing projectiles and others.  When the figures are knocked over, their special powers come into play and influence the game.  For example, granting another one of your figures an attack or bringing back a figure who may have been previously defeated.<br/><br/>This version is based on characters in the Star Wars Universe.<br/><br/>There are multiple themes in the Attacktix series of games.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

It was easy all we had to do was make it simple and quick to play, whilst still blending in a level of complexity that would keep the players interest alive. Well, I am sure that we have succeeded in doing just that.

The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears &amp; Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for. The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black &amp; white illustrations. The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.<br/><br/>To sum up, this was daunting but great fum to create, and to play-test, of which there were many games. There isn't a game like it on the market that I know of, and I know that those who buy a set are going to find it an appealing and tactical game.

Corners have maximum speeds posted in each space, although they can be exceeded for more penalty chart rolls or by staying on the racing line.  There are rules for slipstreaming and pitting.<br/><br/>The game elaborates somewhat on the basic Speed Circuit model.  It tracks wear separately for front and rear tires, has a few extra cornering rules, and has optional weather rules (this is where the different tire types come into play).

The cards are divided into 4 suits, each suit representing a trade: Mechanic, Bricklayer, Farmer or Carpenter. The cards within each suit do not have ranks and display tools or supplies that trade would use. For example, the Farmer cards include seed, a tractor and a scythe. Some cards belong to more than one suit (e.g. the bucket belongs to both the Bricklayer and Farmer suits). In addition, there is a fifth suit, labeled with a 'T'. These cards bear generic goodies like money, Industry, a first aid box and a 'Good Luck' card.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives a card specifying his trade for that hand. The object is to collect as many cards as you can that belong to your trade. At each turn, you pick one card from the previous player's unused cards. If it belongs to your suit, you add it to your sequence. Otherwise, it joins your unused cards which you then offer to the next player, who will pick a card, and so on. 'T' cards are wild cards that you can add to your sequence. There are three 'T' cards with a '?' on them and the words 'dillo tu' (name me). You can only add these cards to your sequence if you can name a tool/object that fits with your trade and is not already used in the game. The 'Good Luck' card has the power of negating an unused card in your hand - if you have the 'Good Luck' card and only one unused card, you can end the game immediately.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player runs out of unused cards. Unused cards count as penalties (I assume this means they subtract one from the length of your sequence).

Spells are used by Monsters to increase their fighting strength; likewise Warriors use Weapons.&quot;<br/><br/>The Character Cards are printed with attack and defense values, and the Specials have either an attack or a defense value.

The first player attacks with 1, 2 or 3 Character cards and some number of Special cards, and the other tries to defend against each attacking Character by laying down a Character and Specials having the same or higher value.<br/><br/>The unique feature is that, according to the rules, each losing Character has a scratch-off area removed, which shows a new and &quot;almost always&quot; weaker attack or defense value.

17352,Subbuteo Cricket,[],"['Action / Dexterity', 'Collectible Components', 'Sports']","Subbuteo Cricket continued the line of sporting dexterity games started by Subbuteo football (soccer).  The game was played on a green beige mat, similar to that use for the soccer version.  The rules mimicked those of cricket (which will doubtless make this review impenetrable to most nationalities).<br/><br/>The bowling side placed the small red plastic ball in the channel in the bowling piece, which was then flicked to propel the ball towards the batsman and a small plastic wicket (complete with separate plastic bails).  The batting action was achieved by spinning a handle attached to a small plastic cricket bat, aiming to hit the ball to score runs; the number of runs scored depended on the distance the ball was hit.<br/><br/>The fielding side set out its players, which were small plastic men each on a molded plastic base which included a cup-shaped depression.  If the ball was hit into one of these depressions, that was a catch.<br/><br/>The rules allowed for run outs (flick the ball to hit the wickets), leg before wickets (a complex and controversial assessment of whether the ball hit the plastic batsman &quot;in line&quot; with the stumps) and even stumping.<br/><br/>The game did not have the genuine skill and excitement of the soccer version, but strangely it did just about work as a contest.<br/><br/>In line with other Subbuteo games, there was a variety of &quot;extras&quot; to buy, including scoreboards and boundary fences.  It was well worth saving your  pocket money in the 1970s to save for the Australian team (baggy green caps), or the West Indians (black players with maroon caps).<br/><br/>",1949,,,
17353,Acquisition,"['Cooperative Game', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Economic'],"According to the rules Acquisition was created for The Shidler Group (a commercial real estate investment firm) by Prince Joli Kansil, presumably as an educational tool of some sort. It is not clear if it was ever published as such.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 12 players plus an umpire, but can be played by fewer (the rules only specifically mention changes for as few as 8 players). The umpire is not strictly necessary, but would make sense if the game were intended to be played by groups of children. The game is played cooperatively.<br/><br/>Each player has his or her own board. Each corresponds to a city or section of a city in the US, and is a stylized representation of one of its commercial real estate districts. Players move around their board by die roll (using the difference of two dice, not the sum) and can buy properties when they land on them. When a player rolls doubles they do not move, but all owned properties pay rent to the owner (from the bank).<br/><br/>There are a few other aspects to the system. When players buy or sell property they may do so at face value or may try rolling a 12-sided die to &quot;negotiate.&quot; Odds are they will do better this way but there is a chance they will do considerably worse. A player may travel to another player's board, which allows them or the other player to propose a joint venture, where both chip in to buy a property. Only the board's player gets rent, but since it is a cooperative game this is not an issue. Finally, there are spaces which cause players to draw event cards which do the usual sorts of things.<br/><br/>Play is for a specified amount of time - 75 minutes is suggested in the rules. At this point the net worth of all players is totaled, and if more than one group is playing (which would require multiple copies of the game), the one with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",1988,,,

When they get the final space, they have to answer a question of a category chosen for the other players before seeing the card.<br/><br/>The game has a very humoristic look and the rulebook is also written in a humorous way (they provide some rules for playing with teams to a maximum of 25 players, and some rules also to play while drinking).<br/><br/>",2000,,,

First, four large ecological areas can be seen in the map on the box cover: Eastern Woodland, Great Plains, Desert West, and Far West.  The tribes appearing on the playing cards are placed in their approximate areas on the map.  The colored border on the cards corresponds to the ecological area of the tribe referred to.<br/><br/>Second, the playing cards can be divided into 14 categories: Food-Plants, Transport, Dwellings, Leadership, Tools, Crafts, Hunting, Warfare, Person-to-Know, Trade, Ceremonies, Treating Ills, Social Control, and Tragedy.  Four cards appear in each category, one from each ecological area.  More information can be found for each of the 56 playing cards in the corresponding Explanation Cards, garnered during the course of the game.  These latter cards may be read aloud for a greater understanding of the cultures during the course of the game, or not if a faster game is sought, but the victor must collect four to accompany the movement of his pawns from the Summer Camp to the Winter Camp.<br/><br/>Hazard and Reward Squares corresponding to the Eagle, the Buffalo, Irrigation, and Fire will be encountered in the journey.  If rewarded, the player attends the Pow Wow, where he is temporarily safe.  A coup is made by landing on another player's pawn.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

The Barbarians do not use their Victory Points for recruiting Units but rather &quot;mobilize&quot; up to a certain number of Armies (how many units depends on the Barbarian People).<br/>Every game will present you with new situations since the Players will work on and change their strategies and the 45 random cards will influence every game in a unique way.<br/>At the end of the seventh turn, the players total their victory points and determine the winner.<br/><br/>Will the Roman Empire rise to Glory or will it be crushed by the overwhelming Barbarians?<br/><br/>It's up to YOU&hellip;<br/><br/>",2008,,,

17442,Kung Fu,['Point to Point Movement'],['Abstract Strategy'],"&quot;Kung Fu: Chess the Yin/Yang Way<br/><br/>Object of the game<br/><br/>The object of the game is for each opposing force to reunite Yin and Yang. The Yin forces try to capture the Yang, and vice versa. Having captured the opposing force, the winner has achieved fulfillment, and the game ends.&quot;<br/><br/>Kung Fu, made in Singapore in the 1970's, is a chess-like game. Instead of a king or general, each player has a Yin/Yang monad and takes on the role of Yin or Yang, controlling a team of Kung Fu fighters (who are dressed in Karategi). The pieces are supposed to represent movements made during the performance of martial arts and have names like Front Kick (Eagle's Onslaught), Hook Kick (Whip of the Dragon's Tail) and Forward Punch (Fist of Fury). Probably influenced by Chinese Chess, each monad is restricted to their own temple of six squares and may not face each other directly in the same file. Unlike Chinese Chess, there is a Guardian piece which stands in front of the monad and which is not restricted to just the temple. However, within the temple, it has the unusual power that when captured within it's own temple, both the Guardian and attacker are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Kung Fu is a curiosity from the heyday of Shaw Brothers films.<br/><br/>",1978,,,

And that&acute;s a pity, because all the ingredient's of a great game are there.<br/><br/>Die Tour is a card driven game and all players have 15 cards (1 card = 1 turn) at the start, which they have to work with, until only 2 are left and the hand is filled up again to 15 cards. On these cards are four numbers (= number of fields, the drivers are allowed to move), one for each of the drivers, every team has at the beginning and sometimes special moves for special situations. Each number has to be attached to one of your drivers and the decision how to divide them, is yours.<br/><br/>Rules for group splitting, mountain races, single driver time races and slipstreaming are included in the basic game, but there exists an (even more rare !) advanced rules set, which the authors played with their gaming buddies. Besides various modifications to the basic version, this advanced rules set includes additional rules for group slowing, card exchanges, team time races and more.<br/><br/>Die Tour allows single races (about 60 minutes playing time and there are flat, mountain and time race stages) or an entire campaign game, which is a series of connected stages. Since there are various roads to victory (champion, best mountain driver, highest points and best team), the campaign game is of course the most interesting way, to play Die Tour, because it reduces the effects of luck. But the kings way, to play Die Tour, is to race a campaign game over many gaming nights and to give little prices to the winners in the different categories every evening and bigger prices for the final winners.<br/><br/>An extremely hard to find game, but if you see it somewhere (best chance probably : On flee markets in Berlin-Germany, because the authors are from there), grab it immediately, because you will not regret it !<br/><br/>",1981,,,

It is a game based on small unit operations so that large battles cannot take place within the context of these rules. [...]<br/><br/>There are two different scales used in Space Marines, in effect, there are two different games here. The basic game uses a time scale of twenty seconds per turn and a normal ground scale of one inch equaling twenty-five meters. In the 'skirmish' rules the time scale is ten seconds per turn and a ground scale of one inch equaling 12.5 meters. The basic scale assumes that the players will have a significant number of figures on the table, possibly ten to twenty per player. The skirmish rules are intended for very small numbers of figures per player, no more than two or three under normal circumstances. The skirmish rules are almost entering into role-playing, although they do not constitute a full role playing system, just a combat system. [...]<br/><br/>",1977,,,

The Prussian army led by King Frederick II (later &quot;the Great&quot; to his admirers) invades Saxony. &quot;Blitzing&quot; through the neutral Saxon electorate he hopes to open a path to Austria&rsquo;s rich Elbe River valley in Bohemia. The Saxon army does not directly resist the invaders but withdraws into a fortified encampment on the Elbe River around Pirna, there awaiting rescue by the Austrians. The Prussian invasion grinds to a halt here; Frederick has no choice but to lay siege. Meanwhile in northern Bohemia, the Austrian army under Field Marshal Browne gathers its strength in preparation for the relief of its new ally.<br/><br/>Retaining the initiative King Frederick split his army, leaving half to keep the Saxons penned in Pirna, while he marches with the rest into Bohemia in search of the Austrians. On the morning of October 1, they stumble onto Browne&rsquo;s army deployed around the little town of Lobositz on the Elbe River. A close fought, ten hour struggle ensues, with charge and counter-charges made across fog masked fields, hills and vineyards before culminating in a street fight amidst burning buildings. Finally, at darkness, the Austrians withdraw in good order, conceding the field.<br/><br/>Although a small battle by Seven Years War standards, the action at Lobositz was significant for having delayed the Austrian relief effort enough to force the Saxon surrender at Pirna. Of greater significance, the Prussians learned that their enemy &ldquo;was no longer the same old Austrians&rdquo; they had previously faced, and a quick victory could not be expected.

You do this by outguessing what your opponent will play.<br/><br/>Each player writes down a sequence of three shapes. The only valid shapes are circle, triangle, square, and pentagon. On each player's turn, the player picks a circle to adjust. The player secretly picks a number of beads and put them in his hand. His opponent does likewise. Every white bead counts for one point. Every black bead counts for one negative point.<br/><br/>Reveal your beads simultaneously and add them up. This will give you a number from -6 to +6. Move the token in your chosen circle that many steps clockwise (for positive numbers) or counterclockwise (for negative numbers). If your total balanced out to zero, the token does not move.<br/><br/>If tokens in three adjacent circles are resting on shapes that match the player's goal, then he wins. Note that the order must match also. If his goal is circle, square, pentagon then tokens resting on circle, pentagon, square don&rsquo;t count. The sequence may be read forward or backward; square, square, circle is the same as circle, square, square.

Shockingly, zombie flesh was the most tender, tastiest, best-aged meat in the world. Preserved by the zombie disease while tenderized by necrotic bacteria, zombie steak made several black-market smugglers very wealthy. Serving zombie steak became an unusual, but chic, status symbol among the elite and wealthy outside North America.<br/><br/>Recognizing the demand for zombie steak, and desperate for revenue to rebuild the economy, the US government did not eradicate the last of the zombies, but herded them into federally controlled and regulated 'zombie ranches'.

Using data from Retrosheet, we've attempted to replicate things like batted ball distribution: your hitters will tend to hit their lazy fly balls and pop ups the other way, while pulling harder hit balls.

But be careful there are foxes around trying to snatch your rabbits and wolves which can eat all your other animals (that is why you need dogs to protect your herd).<br/><br/>The game was designed, and originally named &quot;Hodowla zwierzątek&quot; (&quot;Animal husbandry&quot;) in the occupied Poland during Word War Two by famous polish mathematician Karol Borsuk and his wife. In these hard times the game became very popular and there were many home made copies sold by the Borsuks family. Sadly during the Warsaw rebellion at the end of war all copies were destroyed save one that was in another city. After the war it was returned to the Borsuks family. Now one of the Polish publishers decided to release the game.<br/><br/>The turn of each player consists of two actions: first you have a possibility to exchange your animals according to the special table (e.g for six rabbits you get one sheep, three pigs for a cow) and then you roll two special 12-sided dice with the pictures of animals on the sides. You count the number of pairs of the animals on rolled dice (together with the ones on the farm) and this is how many new animals you get, divided by two. The trick is that there is a fox on one dice and the wolf which are eating your animals.<br/><br/>The game is mostly based on the luck factor (dice). But there is a little strategy to it. Do you go for more &quot;expensive&quot; animals (which have less probability of creating offspring) or you stay with fast breeding but &quot;cheap&quot; rabbits. Do you exchange your animals for an &quot;insurance&quot; (dogs) from the foxes and wolves or risk in order to catch up with others farmers?<br/><br/>Game was intended for children but surprisingly it is also fun for adults.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/><br/>    Have You Herd?

Inset maps are included for high seas naval movement and tactical battle resolution.  176 two-sided mounted and die-cut counters represent regular and militia, Indians, fortresses and fleets.<br/><br/>Reinforcements from Europe are variable depending on naval activity.  Militia must be &quot;mustered,&quot; and &quot;go home&quot; at the end of each campaign year.  Natives are influenced by &quot;gifts and supplies&quot; and by battlefield victories.  Road, Indian trail and Water movement all have key roles in operations.<br/><br/>Battles occur between opposing forces occupying the same point.  Engagements take place on an inset map determined by terrain and situation: &quot;Attacking/Defending Fort,&quot; &quot;Open Ground,&quot; &quot;Wood&quot; (forested) or &quot;Landing.&quot;  Modifiers apply depending on whether engaged units are Regulars, Militia, or Indians, Rangers and Couriers de Bois.  Units engaging in battle line up opposite one another.  A &quot;hit&quot; is determined by a D6 roll of &quot;6.&quot;  Die rolls are modified according to unit type and battle setting (Regulars defending a fort, for example, are &quot;plus 2&quot;, hitting on a four or better).  All units, except Iroquois, are flipped on the first hit and eliminated on the second.  At the start of his/her battle turn, a player may elect to &quot;retreat&quot; in lieu of firing.  Retreating units move to an adjacent friendly point, preferably toward their Base of Operations.  At the end of a victorious battle, flipped pieces are turned back to full strength, and one victorious militia unit, if present, may be &quot;promonted&quot; to a Regular or Ranger (British) or a &quot;Troop of the Marine battalion&quot; or &quot;Courier de Bois&quot; (French).<br/><br/>Fortresses can be built; Towns and Fortresses can be burned.  Supply is critical at the end of a campaign year; all Regular and militia units must occupy either a town or fort, or is not connected by a red road (not trail).  They  must be able to trace supply by road or waterway to their Base of Operations (Montreal or Quebec for the French; Boston, New York or Philadelphia for the British).  Regular or militia units which fail these conditions are eliminated unless they are in a seaport.<br/><br/>The powerful Iroquois Nation is key to victory.  Three of the six Iroquois tribes begin aligned with each side (the counters are two-sided).  After each battle, the victor of that battle flips one Iroquois unit to his/her side.  Any time a player begins his/her turn with all six tribes oriented to his/her side, the Iroquois have joined him/her for the duration.<br/><br/>The other twenty tribes are activated to support the French either by the activities of the Couriers de Bois, or by French bribes (&quot;gifts and supplies&quot;).  Except for the Iroquois, Native tribes usually &quot;go home&quot; after a victory (to celebrate).<br/><br/>Victory is determined by conquest.  The French must begin a turn, or end the game, holding Albany and one of New York, Boston or Philadelphia, or must deny the British their victory conditions.  The British must hold a total of three French cities from the list of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal or Quebec (at least one must be Montreal or Quebec).<br/><br/>",1983,,,

17600,Predators & Prey,[],"['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Educational']","The theme of this game is summed up in the title.  Players are dealt a hand of six cards, each depicting animals.  Each animal is labeled as either PREY or PREDATOR and has a numeric value based on its strength in the wild.  Players also have a playing piece that's actually a small plastic animal (my set has a zebra, a gorilla, an elephant, and a rhinoceros).<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she may either toss their hand and draw six new cards or play a PREY card face up.  Then, going 'round the table to the left, each player may play a PREDATOR card of equal or greater strength.  The next player in succession can only play if their PREDATOR card is of higher strength than any previously played predator.  Also, any predator played against the prey must also inhabit a common continent with the prey (color coded spheres on the cards--see, educational).<br/><br/>If no PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the PREY card moves forward the strength of that card.  If one or more PREDATOR cards were played, the owner of the highest one played battles the owner of the PREY card via an on-board spinner.  A player spins and consults the difference in value between the predator and prey (four possibilities: 0, +1, +2, or higher).  Wherever the spinner stops, simply check to see the color of the difference in values.  If that number is yellow, the prey escapes, if it's red, the predator &quot;captures&quot; the prey.  The owner of the winning animal card moves forward a number of spaces equal to the PREY card's strength.<br/><br/>The spinner is divided into only five segments.  Four seem to be of equal size and the larger one (about 40% of the dial) is all yellow.  So, the odds are with the prey.  But with a more-than-plus-two differential, there's less than a 15% chance of escape.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's PREY turn, she replenishes her hand to six cards.<br/><br/>The movement track is 50 squares long.  First animal playing piece to the end is the winner.<br/><br/>This is probably not technically a children's game, but I think that's the audience that it suits best (though the idea of those cute little animals being &quot;captured&quot; by predators might be a bit much for some kids).<br/><br/>",1996,,,

17651,Under the Lily Banners,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']","['Pike and Shot', 'Wargame']","Under the Lily Banners is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the Thirty Years War. This is the third volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series detailing 17th Century warfare, often known as the Dawn of Modern Warfare. This volume features the rise of the French Army after their entry into the Thirty Years War in 1635. Two of the greatest captains of French history - Louis de Bourbon, the Grand Cond&eacute; and Henri de la Tour, the vicomte de Turenne - take the field to set the stage for Le Grand Siecle - the Golden Age of France under Louis XIV, the Sun King.<br/><br/>After taking on the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War and the combined arms tactics of the Swedes and Imperials in Sweden Fights On, the Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series looks at the French, Spanish and Bavarian armies. The Spanish tercios face the superb French gendarmes. The stalwart Bavarians with their excellent cavalry and love of entrenchments battle the veteran Weimarian cavalry corps.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player that can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include cavalry charges, cavalry pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The five battles in Under the Lily Banners are:<br/><br/>Rocroi 1643 - The debut of the young duc d'Enghien (later known as the Grand Cond&eacute;). The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War that broke the power of the Spanish tercios. The French faced a larger Spanish army but the energetic Enghien refused to quit when all seemed lost and snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Freiburg 1644 - Enghien joined forces with Turenne facing the well entrenched Bavarians. The battle raged for over 3 days until the French were worn down. The French declared victory then bypassed the town. A very different style of battle than any other from the period due to the terrain, style of attack, and duration.<br/><br/>Mergentheim 1645 - The Bavarians surprised Turenne's army and inflicted a stinging blow. This is the smallest battle in the series and is included as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Alerheim aka Second N&ouml;rdlingen 1645 - Turenne, reinforced by Enghien and German Allies from Hesse-Cassel, again faced the entrenched Bavarians. The Bavarians, reinforced by the Imperials, held two hills and the town. Enghien attacked the town and Turenne, at the head of the elite Weimarian cavalry corps, attacked the Bavarian right. The excellent cavalry commander for the Bavarians, Jean de Werth, saw Enghien's attack bog down in the town and attacked the French right, smashing it. The French were losing until the Bavarian commander, Franz von Mercy, fell and in the confusion, allowing Turenne to pull out a victory. The casualties were so heavy the French ended the campaign season three months early.<br/><br/>Lens 1648 - The resurgent Spanish under the Archduke Leopold brother of the Holy Roman Emperor pressed into Flanders to recapture the fortress of Lens. With domestic unrest and a military failure in Spain, the French seemed vulnerable. The Grand Cond&eacute; rushed to the rescue. The Spanish took the high ground, hoping Cond&eacute; would attack as he had at Alerheim. Instead, he turned and began to retire. A cavalry skirmish with the French rearguard escalated and drew both armies into the action piecemeal. The veteran Spanish tercios smashed the elite gardes fran&ccedil;aises, taking their colors as revenge for Rocroi. The French cavalry proved superior and drove off the Spanish horse, leaving the body of infantry isolated on the field where they surrendered en masse. This shattered the last hopes for the Habsburgs, ending their involvement in the Thirty Years War with a defeat.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 backprinted mapsheets (3 one map battles and 2 half-map battles)<br/>1 die<br/>Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>Nominee for the 2005 Charles S.

The first player to reach the center (having made exactly the right number of tricks) is the winner.<br/><br/>There are two ways of achieving this:<br/><br/>1.  By completing full circuits of the board and by moving from one level to the next at selected points.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2.  By means of special squares which send you from outer to inner circuits (or vice versa) in a manner similar to Snakes and Ladders.<br/><br/>The layout of the board forces players to consider in advance how many tricks they require to win so as to land on an advantage square, or avoid a forfeit square.  At the same time they must also consider what they need to do to force their opponents into minimizing the tricks they win, or forcing tricks on them so that they land on a forfeit square.<br/><br/>",1989,,,

The basic game is as described. The standard game adds several features - tracking (ships are placed face-down on the map and only revealed when successfully probed), hyperspace movement (conducted off-map), carrier ships, etc. The advanced game adds a few more features, notably supply points, and more importantly allows players to create their own ship designs (ships in the advanced game have 21 different components, allowing for considerably customization).<br/><br/>There are a few optional scenarios, including one which allows for up to four individual players (this requires either additional copies of the map, or some players to write down their moves).

17694,Tabletop Quarterback,['Dice Rolling'],"['Dice', 'Sports']","From the Developers:<br/><br/>&quot;This game was developed to fill a need in the sports game market.  Our goal was to develop a realistic football game that could be played anywhere in a relatively short time by almost anybody.  Yes there are some very realistic games out there, but they are too complicated for a lot of people to play, such as a father and a son.  Other games are simpler, but they leave out the drama and agony of tough calls (go for it or punt?).  We feel we have met our goals with Tabletop Quarterback.  You can play a game and keep full statistics in less than an hour.  Some of the &quot;experts&quot; who developed this game have been trounced by wives and 11 year old kids.  We think youl like it and get caught up in the action just like we have.&quot;<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>Basic football rules apply; things like 4 tries to make 10 yards, 6 points for a touchdown, 3 points for a field goal.  The risks are here: such as the probability of making a long field goal, an unexpected turnover, a drive-killing penalty.  Usually, sound football savvy will get you through.  But don't be afraid to make some chancey calls as they can work and really turn a game around.<br/><br/>Call play, both players roll dice, compare results to chart.  Repeat as indicated by rules.

You will become one of them in this game. Although they want different things, their paths are already laid out by the fate. It is the way of becoming the strongest in this world of grave adventures, glorious victories, oaths of blood and evil treacheries; in order to leave your footsteps in this time of war and chaos.<br/><br/><br/>Lineage II : The Boardgame is based on a simple roll and move mechanism, played on a small hex map.

Players that matched the judge move one space, and the judge moves one space for each player that matched. Then the selected face is replaced, and the judgeship passes to the next player. Once everyone has been the judge twice for Male faces, you do the same for Female faces, and then for Animal faces. The first round ends when everyone has been the judge 6 times (2 for each type of face.)<br/><br/>In the second round, the number cards are put aside and players are dealt a hand made up of 2 Male, 2 Female, and 2 Animal faces.

At its most complex it becomes a game in which players use identical sets of dice that all need to be manoeuvred into a sequential row, using the eyes to determine movement range.<br/><br/>At the start, players roll their own colour dice (6 in a two player game, 4 in a three player one). Then, in turn, players position these dice on an empty board space, one by one, and never altering the face value. When a player manages to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of 4 own dice, that player wins the round. The victor scores the total pip count of these dice, or the best dice string if the created row exceeds its required length. When all dice are on the board, and no row has been completed, players may move one own die per turn to an adjacent space, but not diagonally. The aim is to score the most points over a given number of rounds.<br/><br/>Anyone vaguely familiar with placement games won't find this much of a challenge, and for these players a couple of trickier variant rules are suggested. Any combination of these variants can be used, to eliminate randomness and increase complexity as desired.<br/><br/>- (2 player only:) to win, a row of 5 or even 6 is needed. <br/>- players don't start by throwing the dice, but use identical sets instead (1-6 or 1-4).<br/>- a winning row also needs to have the dice in the correct sequence, low to high.<br/>- dice may be moved as many squares as their face value, allowing directional changes too.<br/><br/>The designer isn't credited, but in all likelihood it is Hans-Jörg Nürnberger, as Hanje was the vehicle for Hans-J&ouml;rg and Ursula N&uuml;rnberger's own designs.<br/><br/>PUBLICATION HISTORY:<br/><br/>     1975 Hof Hanje Spiele-Atelier - out of print<br/><br/><br/>As with some other Hanje games, the small box is made out of wood, and the board is printed on its lid.<br/><br/>Game seems to be part of the family called &quot;Miniplays&quot;.

The scenarios put the offensive player in an on-field situation. When the offensive player scores or is forced to surrender the ball after failing to score, the players exchange roles and the new offensive player plays under identical conditions.<br/><br/>Play action begins with the defensive player secretly chooses a die. The color of the die determines the defensive stand: against the running play, a short pass or a long pass. The offensive player then announces which of the three plays will be enacted. Defense rolls the die. Offense rolls three dice. Each player checks the appropriate table for results. The higher the number rolled by the players, the more effective their choices were, generally.<br/><br/>Pizza Box Football is shaped like a pizza box... and it opens up into a head-to-head football strategy game designed to offer all the intensity of real football in every play. Players unfold the game board (the field) and lay it inside the unfolded pizza box. The cards guide the players as they play and show the players which dice to roll.<br/><br/>Players must apply football strategy in order to win (when to run, when to short pass, when to long pass and when to try to fool the other team). Also available are additional plays from the expansion (sold separately) that extend the offensive strategy to include draws, screen passes and play-action passes and add run blitzes, route jumps and QB blitzes for the defense.  These plays work with the existing PBF game.  (The full expansion features 32 teams with different strengths on offense and on defense.)<br/><br/>Pizza Box Football lets players feel like a coach, a player and a fan all at once.

All other teams are represented by a generic &quot;unranked&quot; team. A season is then played out for the ranked teams. The game scores are based on the teams' rankings; the better a team is ranked, the more likely it is do score well and win. Each game takes only a few seconds to resolve (using a specially-created deck of cards), and a scoreboard for each week is created using the results of these games. After each week, the players vote on where each ranked team should be newly ranked (invariably dropping some of them from the rankings entirely), and a new set of rankings is generated prior to the next week's play.<br/><br/>At the end of the season, the major bowl games are determined based on rankings and conference alignment, and then played to determine the final rankings.<br/><br/>There is an option for players to secretly select teams at the start of the season so that they are actually competing against one another.<br/><br/>Betting is optional, either with the basic game or the variant, but a &quot;modified mean&quot; must be used in calculating the rankings to prevent players from skewing the results by ranking their own favorites unreasonably high.<br/><br/>Good for an afternoon of fun for the college football fanatic.

It includes most of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. 18Scan is a small game, in the style of Mark Derrick&rsquo;s 'one-state' games 18GA and 18AL, and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Designer Notes: &quot;This is my second attempt at a 'small, short' 18xx game: the first, 18VA, has matured -- alas! -- into a solid, medium-length performer, but has become quite unsuited for a quick 'fill-in-the-cracks' session. I am hoping that 18Scan will not only prove to be a better short game, but will be sufficiently straightforward that it can also be used as an introduction to the 18xx system.  In 18Scan, I hope to bring to the table a simple game, yet with some strategic options, and a forgiving game -- unlike, say, 1830: Railways & Robber Barons. At the same time, 18Scan has a number of subsystems (Minor Companies, a merger railroad, Destinations, various categories of trains) that provide a panoply of the wide variety within the 18xx gaming space.&quot;<br/><br/>",2005,,,
17858,Rise of the Red Army,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Civil War', 'Economic', 'Wargame']","&quot;The Rise of the Red Army is a territorial strategy game covering the Russian Revolution following World War I. Historical representation of the Bolshevik, Siberian, and Crimean factions, including the Polish invasion of Russia, Japanese occupation, and independence movements from Finland and the Baltic States.&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes in a small box, with two large folded (very folded) semi-laminated maps. The components are plastic poker chips with stickers the players affix themselves.<br/><br/>The rules are closely based on Axis and Allies. Each player plays one or more nations, each varying in size and power. There is much greater variation in starting power and capabilities in this game than there is in Axis and Allies. The Bolsheviks control numerous units and a vast swath of territories, while other nations begin with only a handful of each. This imbalance in power is offset by the setting of different victory conditions for each nation. Furthermore, the victory conditions vary depending on how many players are playing and what nations they each control.<br/><br/>Resource collection rules are basically the same as Axis and Allies, (the generic &quot;resources&quot; are equivalent to the &quot;IPC's&quot; from Axis and Allies, i.e. each territory is worth a certain number of resources) with slight variations for some nations. For example, the Northern and Crimean White Russian forces gain extra resources if they keep control of their ports (representing aid from the U.K., U.S., and France), while the Bolsheviks and Ukrainian Anarchists gain extra resources from any of the core Russian areas they control (representing support from the local populace).<br/><br/>Combat rules also follow Axis and Allies, with some extra rules for trenches (which aid defense), bi-planes (very weak in the game), generals (who can add their &quot;combat factors&quot; to any units they share an area with when attacking or defending), etc. Ten-sided dice are used for combat. Certain nations, such as the Bolsheviks, Poles, and Ukrainians, have more effective infantry than others. The handful of Czech infantry controlled by the Siberian White Russians also gain bonuses in combat.<br/><br/>After combat, players must spend resources to &quot;incorporate&quot; the territories they conquer. Only after a territory has been incorporated can the new owner collect resources from it.<br/><br/>The number of territories on the map is enormous. This increases tactical opportunities, but it would seem that this could make resource collection somewhat onerous for some nations. While the Poles begin the game with 31 resources, the Bolsheviks begin with 306! Of course, the Bolsheviks are under attack from nearly every direction, so they need the bonus.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Germany is faced with mortal enemies on two fronts. She must eliminate one threat, or face being crushed between the two. The German strategist von Schlieffen plans one of the great military gambles of all time. His scheme is to concentrate to knock France out of the war before Russia can fully mobilize. The bulk of German forces will move through neutral Belgium. Graf von Schlieffen intends to fall on the flank of the French armies. He believes the French will over commit to regaining their lost provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. The Schlieffen plan runs into complications from the moment it is launched. The Belgians fight back. The British join the fray. The French display surprising flexibility. Can the invading German armies still defeat France? Or will the French, British, and Belgians stop them? This time, it is up to you.<br/><br/>May 1915 - Artois<br/><br/>The immediate threat to France is over. The Germans have re-deployed substantial forces to the Eastern Front. French and British reinforcements arrive in increasingly telling numbers. The French believe the opportunity has come to expel the invaders. Both sides have used the lull since 1914 to dig in. Trench lines stretch from Switzerland to the English Channel. The Germans may be weaker, but they stand inside the most extensive field fortifications the world has yet seen.<br/>February 1916 - Verdun<br/><br/>The Germans reduced the Russian threat in 1915. Now the German Field Marshal von Falkenhayn believes he can eliminate France through a battle of attrition. An epic struggle that will sear the bodies and souls of both nations begins. Both sides will feel the effects of losses on a national scale. Yet neither will shrink from the cost of the sacrifice.<br/><br/>July 1916 - The Somme<br/><br/>The new British Army is ready. With German attention focused on Verdun, the British feel they have a chance to break through. An intense, week long bombardment will pulverize the German lines before the attack begins. The British climb over the top and begin to cross no-man's land. The Germans survived the shelling and doggedly defend their line. Bitter fighting will last for months in the valley of the Somme.<br/>April 1917 - Nivelle's Offensive<br/>The French are now led by General Nivelle, a hero of Verdun. He plans a two pronged attack against the German salient pointing at Paris. He intends for his &quot;Army of the Rupture&quot; to be through German lines in a day. The problem is the Germans also see the potential of his plan. They retreat to the formidable defenses of the Hindenburg Line. Nivelle plows ahead regardless. The soldiers of the French army are rather unhappy with the result.<br/><br/>March 1918 - The Great Offensive<br/><br/>The Russians are out of the war. The Germans now concentrate in France with divisions trained in new assault tactics. The Stosstrupen are aimed at the weak point of depleted British lines. The Germans will have to win before tanks and American troops will tip the scales against them. Can the British and French hold out until a counter-offensive is possible?

When the Quibble sticks are laid side by side, they join to form then lines of ten letters each. Each stick has four sides, with a different combination of ten letters on each side, so that whenever the Quibble sticks are scrambled, a new combination of letters will appear. In each game, the players form words of three letters or more from the letters appearing across the Quibble sticks.<br/><br/>By mathematical calculation, it has been determined that there are 1,048,576 permutations possible in each line of ten letters. This represents the number of different letter combinations possible in each of the Quibble sticks. So, ten time this figure is the number of possible combinations within a game of Quibble.<br/><br/>The players write down their words simultaneously and the scores are tallied after each round. For a faster, more vigorous game, play with 2 players and a recorder in which players call out the words. Only the first one to say a word can score for that word. Points are scored based on the length of each word written down (ex: 3 points for 3-letter word).<br/><br/>--According to Sid Sackson's &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot;:<br/><br/>Ten generously sized wooden sticks have ten letters arranged vertically on each face.

Enjoyed throughout the Kabaka's palace, it was played by the King with his principal wives and chiefs.&quot;<br/><br/>As in other versions of this game the essential strategy of Omweso is to capture your opponent's marbles without leaving yourself open to capture.  All of the marbles are kept in play during course of the game, being captured and recaptured across the board.<br/><br/>Like Bao the game is played on a board with 32 pits with each player having an inner and outer row of 8 pits each.<br/><br/>A move consists of collecting all the marbles from a pit and placing them one by one in subsequent pits in an anti-clockwise direction (or optionally in a clockwise direction if from a player's four left hand pits).  If the last marble is dropped into a pit containing marbles, all of these are collected up and play continues.  This continues until the last marble of the move is dropped into an empty pit.<br/><br/>Marbles present in both the inner and outer rows are vulnerable to capture, and, in order to capture a player must drop the last marble of a move into any occupied pit opposite vulnerable marbles.  Captured marbles come across the board and play continues.<br/><br/>The game is won when the opponent is left with empty pits or pits containing only single marbles.<br/><br/>",0,,,

This apprenticeship is the foundation upon which the professional career is built.<br/><br/>Professional Footballer - As a professional, the player strives to maintain a high standard, on and off the pitch.

After completing three circuits any Skill and Effort tokens earned are traded in for a potential rating which determines which of four paths that player follows through the Professional Stage.<br/><br/>Progress through the Professional Stage is, once again, dependent on the roll of the dice with the effects of the square being detailed in look-up tables contained in the rule book.  The idea is to proceed to the International Stage as quickly as possible, collecting goal tokens on the way.<br/><br/>During the International Stage players roll two dice (one advantage, one penalty) to progress.

When a druid leaves a space, he leaves a stone behind. Once a player has a majority of stones around a dolmen space (at least two stones, with another player having one stone), she gets to place a dolmen. If another player adds a stone so the amount of stones is tied (2-2, for example), he gets to place a dolmen beneath the stack. When somebody again gets the majority (3-2, for example), he or she places a dolmen on top of the stack. Making sure your 4-point dolmen gets on the top of the stack in a large, valuable area is something of a challenge.<br/><br/>The game ends when somebody runs out of dolmens or stones. Unfinished areas are scored in the end (finished areas are scored as soon as they're done) and the player with the highest points wins the game.<br/><br/>The description from the publisher's website describes what the theme is about:<br/><br/>Die Dolmeng&ouml;tter is a luck-free majorities game.

In their center were frequently dolmen, which rank among the oldest megaliths and whose meaning is still not perfectly clear.<br/><br/>The artistic representation of gods on the dolmen - Dolmeng&ouml;tter - led to the assumption that the dolmen served the druids as meditation areas, in which their reincarnation-based cult was practiced.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Each player is also provided with a training schedule on which their training progress is recorded.<br/><br/>Players start the game by undertaking training which is conducted on the training circuit.  They complete one lap of the training circuit, based on the results of dice rolls.  The type of square landed on (e.g. hill training, training injury, new shoes etc..) is recorded on the training record, so that by the time that training is completed players will have had differing experiences as a result of their training.<br/><br/>Once all players have completed their training the Marathon race itself commences.  Play progresses one throw at a time with penalties being dictated by the square on which the piece lands.  Some penalties apply to all players, others only if the penalty is applicable to one of the events experienced during training (e.g.  &quot;Into the wall for injury&quot; would only apply to a player who had been injured during training.)  Once the penalty is spent the training incident is canceled on the training record.<br/><br/>Many of the penalties involve &quot;hitting the wall&quot; -  that part of the Marathon where running becomes particularly difficult and you wonder whether it is all worthwhile.  In the game this represented by having to complete a circuit of the 20 space &quot;wall&quot;.  The main playing pieces remains where it is on the Marathon circuit and the other counter is used to mark progress around the wall.

Despite simple rules each game quickly develops into an exciting challenge. The goal of two players or two teams is to be the first to bring their own balls home.  But that is easier said than done, because only strong team play and forethoughted, flexible tactics pave the way to success.  Perceive the plans of the opposing team and cancel them.  But caution is required:  it can happen that you must lose ground, although you do not want to.  Finally, heavenly creatures interfere during play.  A powerful warrior may step on the board and rearrange the balance of power.  An angel may appear to rescue someone from great emergency - but whom?<br/><br/>TAC is suitable both for fast, fun games and for tense, strategic, but friendly games.  Each game develops differently from the last and guarantees timeless fun.<br/><br/><br/>See 6-TACVery similar to the traditional games DOG, Super Tock 4, Super Tock 6, Tock 6 and Super Tock 8<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Albert likes tiles which form circles, Boris instead prefers squares. Whenever they worked together they spent more time arguing than working. One time, two palettes of tiles were destroyed (one forming circles and one with squares), so something had to change. Since that day, Albert and Boris use only tiles which can be used to form circles and squares as well and they play 'Turnio' while they work.&quot;<br/><br/>Turnio is a tactical game for two players Ages 10 and up. The chips show on two or four corners quarters of circles or squares. Each player chooses one of these symbols. The players try to place or turn the chips in a way that completes their symbols. Two quarters of the same symbol placed side by side are called a pair. Quarters which touch only at the corner, i.e. which are placed diagonally are by definition not a pair. For each pair completed, the player gains one point. That means a half of a symbol is worth one point, three-quarters two points and a complete symbol gives four points.

Players take turns to throw a D6, moving their pieces and following the instructions on the board.  These will generally involve taking cards (which are used later in the game) or placing a bet.  Betting involves placing a marker on the Betting card to indicate, for example, that the yellow player thinks the red dog will come 4th.<br/><br/>Play continues like this until a player's piece passes the &quot;Go to the Traps&quot; space, at which point he/she completes their bets by filling up their betting column, and move their dog to a free trap to await the start of the race.  Once in the traps the player must way until all the other traps are filled.<br/><br/>The Race:<br/>The race phase comprises two actions:<br/>- Playing a card (if you have one) and following the instructions on it.<br/>-  Roll three dice and, using the score on each of the dice to move one of the seven playing pieces forward - three of the pieces (two dogs and the hare, or three dogs) move each turn.<br/><br/>A roll of 10 (on the three dice) allows a player to position a lampost in the path of one of the dogs which prevents the dog from moving until the lampost is moved.<br/><br/>The hare is moved in the same way as the dogs but is normally  in the lead.  If one of the dogs overtakes the hare it is deemed to have eaten it, and is &quot;lamposted&quot;.  At this point the hare is dead and takes no further part in the game, but is deemed (on account of the fact that it is in the dog's stomach) to finish immediately after the dog for betting purposes.<br/><br/>Once a dog crosses the finish line it is placed on the betting card in the position corresponding to where it actually finished the race.  The player owning the dog keeps playing however so as to influence where the other dogs finish.<br/><br/>Once all the dogs are finished, the actual result is compared against the predictions with players scoring as follows:<br/>- 15 points - correct prediction of the winner.<br/>- 10 points - correct prediction of any other position.<br/>- 5 points - almost correct (one place out) prediction of any postition.<br/><br/>Scores are totalled and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",1998,,,

18061,Chennault's First Fight,"['Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']","['Wargame', 'World War II']","Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>As 1941 moved from winter into spring, and then into summer, it was becoming increasingly apparent that war was coming to the United States. Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.<br/><br/>Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.<br/><br/>Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a &quot;battle board&quot; that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.<br/><br/>Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show. Running up a butcher's bill, or calling in forces badly needed elsewhere in the Emperor's warplan can lead to a lose of face and worse. The Allied player has precious little to waste in this fight, and must make the most of his opponent's weaknesses and mistakes while minimizing his own.<br/><br/>Rules cover enhanced reinforcements for both sides, the Vichy, Aces, Amphibious Assaults, the possible intervention of the Japanese Kido Butai (Carrier Air Units) and weather. Plenty of carnage and mayhem!<br/><br/>",2005,,,

The attack is done as follows: the player rolls the five d6, after which he can re-roll the dice he wants (however, each time he must keep at least one die, so that the attack will be composed at most of five rolls).<br/><br/>The goal is to try to damage the opponent, with each &ldquo;6&rdquo; being a possible damage.<br/><br/>When the attacker has completed his throws, the defender must try to parry: he chooses one of the numbers shown by the dice and throws all the dice that show that number. But beware!: with a single roll now he has to obtain at least one die with a higher number, and he has only one possibility.<br/><br/>If he fails, he suffers one damage for each &ldquo;6&rdquo; that the attacker has rolled, plus an additional damage.

18098,Napoleon's Triumph,"['Area Movement', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation']","['Napoleonic', 'Wargame']","(From the publisher)<br/><br/>Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44&quot; x 34&quot; map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon&rsquo;s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.<br/><br/>From Back of Box<br/>On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44&quot; x34&quot; map of the battlefield.<br/><br/>In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.<br/><br/>The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.<br/><br/>Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality.  The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.<br/><br/>To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.<br/><br/>In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.<br/><br/>",2007,,,

Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions.

China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. <br/>A special variant with fortifications is included.<br/><br/>Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

18105,Atlantis,['Modular Board'],"['Abstract Strategy', 'Territory Building']","This game was invented at the Technical University Twente in The Netherlands.<br/><br/>Atlantis is very original in its mechanisms. The board is built up from segments, each consisting of 7 hexes: one in the middle and six around it. The board can be made quite large, but is usually something like 4x4 segments; the game takes longer as the board gets larger. Each player has pieces of a single color. Pieces can be stacked, but when the stack gets as least as high as the number of neighbouring hexes, it explodes, spreading one piece to each surrounding hex and eventually destroying the original field. Once all seven hexes of a segment have been destroyed, the entire area disappears and segment is removed. Thus, during the course of a game the board (Atlantis) sinks into the waves.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to conquer as many free hexes as possible. An area is conquered if it can be only touched by hexes without enemy-pieces. But beware: Exploding hexes have the nasty tendency to turn into an unstoppable front of explosion and destruction.<br/><br/>As far as I know this game has not been released commercially, but nevertheless it has a large playing community, since the University Game Club (Fanaat) has now more than one generation of offspring players. The game plays best with 2, 3 or 6 players, for symmetry reasons. 4 players is possible, but since the board is not mirror-symmetric the players will not have equivalent starting positions.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

The gameboard has a fort which houses the 12 cavalry markers while on the opposite side of the board an Indian village houses the 12 Indians.  A one-way path winds around the board, with the Indians moving in one direction, while the cavalry move in the opposite, which means they'll come head to head in a short while.<br/><br/>The Indians player leads off, spinning the spinner, which has values of 0 to 10; the player moves his first marker accordingly.  The cavalry player follows in suit.  On the next Indian spin, the player moves the Indian marker already in play and adds a new one from the village, each moving the distance the spinner indicates. Play continues on with each player soon moving several of his markers on each turn.<br/><br/>Each marker counts for 10 men, and there are several spaces scattered across the board which, when landed upon, indicate you must lose 10 men.  Essentially, that marker is removed from the game, not to return.  Also, when a player lands on an opponent's marker, he captures that piece and moves into his fort or village.  Additionally, a few spaces allow a player to raid his opponent's fort or village and re-capture his captured markers.<br/><br/>Eventually, through such attrition, one player will find he has no markers left out on the trail.  At that point, if he is holding some of his opponent's markers captive, he may trade his captives for his own markers, place them in his respective fort or village, and move them into play as normal.  If, however, a player has no markers on the trail, and no captives in his fort or village, he loses the game, giving his opponent the victory.  Thus, the markers have no end destination and may move round and round the board, victory coming only when the opponent has lost all of his markers.<br/><br/>",1955,,,

18121,Casino,"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection']",['Card Game'],"Casino is a fishing standard deck playing card game based on the traditional Italian game Scopa.  It is one of the few card games played with all cards in a standard 52 card deck that can be dealt out evenly to 2, 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>Play starts with four cards to each player and four cards to the table.  Each numeral card is counted as its numerical value.  The aim is to capture cards laying on the table by playing a card from hand which matches in number a table card or the sum of several table cards (for example, a 2 and an 8 can be captured by a ten).  Cards can also be stacked, called a &quot;build&quot;, to be taken next turn only if you have that card in your hand to take it later, risking their capture by another opponent (for example, a 2 and an 8 can have a 10 stacked upon it, next turn you can take the pile with another 10 and so can an opponent, capturing four cards).  Face cards are captured by the same face card.<br/><br/>Cards must be played onto the table, called &quot;trailing&quot;, if there is nothing to capture.  Picked up cards are accumulated in a pile to be counted at the end of the round.  Once all players four card hands are depleted four cards are again dealt to each player (only deal the table on the first hand of a deck).  This happens until the deck is spent.  Cards remaining on the table after the deck is spent are won by the last player to capture a card.   Scoring depends on the variant.<br/><br/>Most commonly the points total 11.  Per the rules published at pagat.com the scoring is as follows.<br/><br/>Most cards = 3 points<br/>Most spades = 1 point<br/>10 of Diamonds (&quot;Big Casino&quot;) = 2 points<br/>Deuce of Spades (&quot;Little Casino&quot;) = 1 points (also counted as a spade in Most Spades count)<br/>Each Ace = 1 point (4 points with the Ace of spades counting towards most spades).<br/><br/>A total of 11 points per deck, shuffling the deck again and starting over playing to 21.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Anathema<br/><br/><br/>",1800,,,

If, however they have a female or females caged at the entrance to their conservation park, and they think that one of them is the mate of the male that they have just landed next to, they may attempt to turn that female face up:<br/>-  If they are correct they remove the male from the playing board and place it with the female face down in the conservation park (not back in the cage).  This breeding pair takes no further part in the game<br/>-  If they choose the wrong female then it is simply turned face down again on the conservation park board.<br/><br/>Unscrupulous conservationists may also &quot;steal&quot; breeding females from other player's conservation parks.  When a player lands alongside a male and they think that one of the other players has its mate in one of their cages then they can attempt to steal it by turning it over:<br/>-  If they are correct then the piece is &quot;stolen&quot; and moved to one of their own cages.<br/>-  If they are wrong, it is returned face down where it came from, and if the erring player has any females in his own cages then one of them is released back to one of the free yellow squares in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>No more than one conservationist can occupy the same space on the outside track, and spaces that are not next to males (i.e. the male has already been claimed) are not counted for movement purposes.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all the females have been paired, the player with the greatest number of breeding pairs in their conservation park is the winner.<br/><br/>",1985,,,

It contains pads, pencils, card stands, 47 numbered cards, 10 spyglass cards, and 24 Spy Route Cards.<br/><br/>Each player takes a Spy Route Card and places it in a card stand so that he can see it, but no-one else can.  On each card is the route of a spy, starting from one of six embassies, passing through the Secret Service building, and progressing to a point where the Spy is caught.  Each route is 12 points long, passing through 12 of the 47 numbered points on the card.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to determine the route of the spy on the card to your left.  Every turn you may ask the player on your left about one location on the Route Card.  This is done by the use of the number cards by:<br/>-  Taking the top card from the number deck and playing one card from what is then a hand of 5 (4 cards remain in the hand).<br/>-  Calling out the top card from the discard pile.<br/>-  Using a Spyglass card to ask about any location on the route.<br/><br/>When a number is called the player to the left checks the route and provides one of the following responses:<br/>-  If the number is on the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Confirmed&quot;.<br/>-  If the number is adjacent to and in visual contact with the spy's route then the sighting is &quot;Witnessed&quot;.<br/>-  If it is neither of the above then there is &quot;No Sighting&quot;.<br/><br/>Information gained is marked accordingly on a Detector Pad.<br/><br/>At any time during a player's turn a player may try to guess the spy's route.  To do this he must call out the 12 numbers of a continuous route, in sequence, starting from the embassy to the spy's point of capture.  The first player to do this correctly is the winner.<br/><br/>",1988,,,

The winner is the player who can strike a balance between greed and conscience during the 100 years (60 minute) duration of the game.<br/><br/>Commodity cards are distributed evenly between the players - these indicate the jigsaw pieces on which this particular activity can take place and environmental (green) or industrial (gray) means by which the commodity can be exploited. Environmentally sound exploitation allows the jigsaw pieces to be placed green side up, and green tokens to be earned. Industrial exploitation requires the jigsaw piece to be gray side up, but generates income. Pieces can change from green to gray and vice versa dependent on how they are used.<br/><br/>Play involves taking a Fate Card, and following the instructions on it, rolling the die and moving. If the place moved to is on one of their commodity cards then it is ticked off - if not a question must be answered.<br/><br/>When 60 minutes (100 years) have passed, play ceases and the green jigsaw pieces are counted. If the required number of pieces (this is a group task and depends on the number of players) have not been turned to green, the Earth is lost and there is no winner ... If the required number have been achieved, the player that has accumulated 10 green tokens, 300 million and visited all the destinations listed on their commodity cards wins.

Probes have been sent to Mars, and soon astronauts will be manning rockets in order to mine the planet for newly discovered resources. The first is a brand new element, Celerium, that could prove to be a combustible energy source the likes man has never seen. The second is Sylvanite, an incredibly dense material unlike anything found on earth. In addition to these resources, glaciers have been discovered on the planet. Whoever controls these icy masses could work to create a livable atmosphere on Mars<br/><br/>In Mission: Red Planet, players work as mining companies compete to send astronauts to Mars in order to colonize and mine for recently discovered materials. Over the course of 10 rounds, players play one of their special agents every round to help fill the rockets heading to Mars with their own astronauts while simultaneously working to prevent their opponents from doing the same. Once landed, these astronauts must gather to control specific regions of the planet, each yielding one of the three resources: Celerium, Sylvanite, or Ice. After rounds 5 and 8, players gain score tokens for every region where they control the majority of the astronauts. At the end of the game, players score one final time, adding any bonuses received from Discovery Cards and Bonus Cards. The player with the most score tokens at the end controls Mars, and all the riches it can bring!<br/><br/>From Bruno Faidutti's website:<br/><br/>This one, designed with Bruno Cathala, started with the theme. We wanted to make a game about colonizing Mars, with shuttles leaving the blue planet towards the red one. The theme is strong, and well caught in the steampunk graphic style decided by Asmodée. In Mission: Red Planet, each player plays a colonial power which sends astronauts, in space shuttles, to occupy the most promising zones on the planet. For scholars, the systems merge a majority game, &agrave; la El Grande or San Marco, with a character/action card system, somewhere between Citadels and Hoity Toity/Adel Verpflichtet.

(You will find a &lsquo;Quick Start Guide&rsquo; on the back of the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo;.)<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to be the most successful Wheeler Dealer&trade; and depending on which level is played, be the first to have a total wealth of up to 3,000,000 &lsquo;credits&rsquo;. Players start with 8,250 &lsquo;credits&rsquo; and a random hand of 4 red and 4 green &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards on level 1.  Players accumulate wealth by selectively buying and selling &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards one at a time, until a &lsquo;set&rsquo; of 3 or more identical cards has been built.  Once a &lsquo;set&rsquo; has been built it may be sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; for 2, 3 or 4 (sometimes more) times the &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  It is good practice to place the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to be sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; in the middle of the playing board.  &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards sold to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; are placed at the bottom of the coloured coded deck.<br/><br/>Players must start on the &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo;, from any of the blue spaces, in a clockwise direction. Players may only progress to the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; when they have sufficient total wealth (150,000 &lsquo;Credits&rsquo; level 1).  As soon as one player reaches the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; all other players are permitted to enter also, even if they do not have sufficient wealth.  Wealth is accumulated faster on the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo;, however, there are greater risks.  All players must announce that they are going to enter the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; before the dice are thrown. Before throwing the dice to move around either &lsquo;circle&rsquo;, players may buy one &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card from any other player for 3 times the &lsquo;face value&rsquo;. Other players do not have to sell and only one card may be bought at a time.  If buying a card makes a &lsquo;set&rsquo; of 3 or more the player may also sell the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; before throwing the dice to move around the &lsquo;circle&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Players may at any time during their turn secure loans on other &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; cards in their possession at &frac12; &lsquo;face value&rsquo; which is known as the &lsquo;At Risk Value&rsquo;. Such cards must be placed on the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo;, unless they form part of the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to be sold immediately to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;.  &lsquo;At Risk&rsquo; cards may be bought by other players, when it is their turn, at 2 times &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  If asked, the owner of an &lsquo;At Risk&rsquo; card must sell it to the other player, repay the bank the &lsquo;At Risk Value&rsquo;, plus 10% interest. It is good practice to place the &lsquo;At Risk Zone Card&rsquo; to your left, thereby keeping your cards and money away from the other players.<br/><br/>Once the above options have been exhausted, the player then rolls the dice (2 &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo; 1 &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo;) and moves his playing piece the number of spaces rolled in a clockwise direction.  The player turns over the top card of the colour landed on and may buy the &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card at &lsquo;face value&rsquo;.  If buying this card makes a &lsquo;set&rsquo;, you must wait until your next turn before selling the &lsquo;set&rsquo; to the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;.  If a player does not have or cannot raise enough money to buy the &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card or does not want it, the player must pay the &lsquo;bank&rsquo; 10% of the &lsquo;face value&rsquo; to cover the &lsquo;Handlers Charge&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card is placed to the bottom of the colour coded deck. If the player cannot raise enough money to pay the &lsquo;Handlers Charge&rsquo; bankruptcy must be declared.  When landing on a yellow space (outer circle), players have the option of turning over a yellow &lsquo;Commodity&rsquo; card buying it or paying the &lsquo;Handlers Charge&rsquo;, or turning over a blue &lsquo;Command&rsquo; card and following the &lsquo;Commands&rsquo;.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a blue space &lsquo;outer circle&rsquo; a 5,000 &lsquo;Credit&rsquo; bonus is paid to the player from the &lsquo;bank&rsquo;. The player also takes a blue card (&lsquo;Command&rsquo; card) from the top of the deck and follows the &lsquo;Commands&rsquo; exactly. If a player lands on a blue space on the &lsquo;inner circle&rsquo; no bonus is paid but a &lsquo;Command&rsquo; card must be taken from the top of the blue deck and &lsquo;Commands&rsquo; followed exactly.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

The first player to pull at least 5 pieces onto any combination of his or her home intersections is the winner.<br/><br/>Both players simultaneously reveal their moves, which consist of &quot;pulling&quot; the end of a particular string toward the edge of the board.<br/><br/>Between turns, stacks of pieces rest on the string intersections.  These stacks are moved, split and/or combined when the ends of the strings connected to those intersections are pulled.  Stacks stop when they reach the edge of the grid.<br/><br/>Stacks pulled in two different directions are split into two equal stacks, with extra pieces added as necessary when odd stacks are split.  If the same string end is pulled by both players, the stacks on that string move, but the extra stress causes the string to break.  After such a move, that string cannot be pulled for the duration of the game.<br/><br/>Bonus: Includes letters in American Sign Language on the back side.<br/><br/>",2003,,,

It's a sequel in that it's a whole bunch of new Fluxx cards for the fans who've been craving new stuff, which can be combined with the original or enjoyed standalone; it's a retread in that the core game is the same, and many of the &quot;new&quot; Keepers and Goals are cards that have previously been seen in promo card form or in earlier editions of the game; and it's an experiment in that we're interested in seeing how well people like this leaner, simpler, smaller version of the game.

If the player finishes on a  water hazard spot then a hazard card is taken and then penalty shown on the card carried out.<br/><br/>Players maneuver their tugs until they are in the space immediately in front of the ship that they have been directed to tow (this is decided by a secret card deal at the start of the game). At this point they are considered to have connected a tow-line to their charge.  They then tow the ship back across the board to that ship's designated mooring point, dealing with any hazards encountered on the way.<br/><br/>Once they have moored the ships in the appropriate berth, the tugs then have to return to their own mooring point.  The winner is the first player to have successfully towed his designated ship to the correct mooring point and then returned his/her tug to its mooring position.<br/><br/>",1990,,,

18325,The Siege of Port Arthur,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']",['Wargame'],"The Siege of Port Arthur, just before midnight on February 8, 1904, the Russian fleet based at Port Arthur, on the southern tip of the Kwantung Peninsula, was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats, elements of Admiral Togo's fleet. The attack having been made prior to a declaration of war, the Russians were taken by surprise. Thirty - seven years later, Pearl Harbor became the focal point of the same type of treachery.<br/><br/>General Nogi, Commander of the Japanese Third Army, was sent reeling back with 15,000 casualties after his first headlong assault on the newly constructed, although archaically designed fortresses...a tragic surprise for the man who had easily taken the town from the Chinese in 1894. Five long months of trench fighting finally delivered the costly prize.<br/><br/>The capture of Port Arthur was of urgent need for the fulfillment of the Japanese &quot;grand plan&quot;. First, it would deny an ice - free port to the Russian fleet.    Second, it would keep lines of communication free between Japan and Manchuria. Third, a quick victory without excessive losses would give the Third Army to Marshal Oyama in the field to crush the Russian Army before it could build up to an overwhelming strength. All this had to be done before Japan ran out of soldiers, and, more important, money!<br/><br/>The Siege of Port Arthur was chosen as the topic of this game for two main reasons. First, it expressed a desire to see a game equipped with an in - depth prepared defense system in which one side is totally defensive and the other totally offensive.    Second, the Russo-Japanese War was a sneak preview of things to come.<br/><br/>The American Civil War and the Crimean War have been billed as the dawn of modern warfare, but the Russo-Japanese War took this one step farther and showed the world the devastation accompanying such warfare. The use of heavy artillery, hand grenade, electrified fence, barbed wire, trenches and, a new twist, gas, was on display for the military leaders of Europe to observe, evaluate, and use nine years later in Flanders and along the Marne. The German observation team at Port Arthur recognized the benefit of heavy artillery and encouraged its development much to the dissatisfaction of the French Army in 1915.<br/><br/>Game comes in a zip-lock bag.

18326,Napenaltowaksche,"['Action Points', 'Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling']","['American Indian Wars', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","From the Introduction: &quot;Napenaltowaksche is the skirmish level portion of the Flintlocks and Tomahawks system.  The setting is mid 18th-century New England, New France and the Old Northwest.  Where a choice had to be made between playability and realism, the choice was made toward ease of play so that the result is closer to a caricature rather than a historical simulation.&quot;<br/><br/>The game name is spelled both Napenaltowaktsche and Napenaltowaksche by the designer throughout the booklet.  It's Lenni Lenape (Delaware Indian) for &quot;They will be scalping each other,&quot; and I don't think the Lenni Lenape much care how you spell it so long as you pronounce it correctly.<br/><br/>It's a skirmish level miniatures wargame, where one figure represents one person.  The game was sold either simply as the rules alone (with basic character cards and player aids to photocopy), or as a full kit with felt and wood terrain, eight painted miniatures (4 Indians, 4 colonists), chits, character cards, player aid cards, movement stick, etc.<br/><br/>The mechanics contain a fair bit of randomness.  A chit for each figure in the game is put into a cup along with three &quot;end of turn&quot; chits - draw a chit to see who moves next.  The player owning the active figure rolls a d6 and adds its current Competence (which starts at 6 and drops as you take wounds) to get a number of action points available for a turn.  Moving one cm takes 1 AP, while loading your flintlock takes 12 AP, tracked on your character card in groups of 4 AP.<br/><br/>If a figure is fired at and the shot comes reasonably close, they must make a reaction check to see what they do.  This can range from running away to holding your ground to firing wildly to charging into melee - the more wounded you become, the more likely you are to run away.<br/><br/>Rules are given for aiming and firing, melee, line of sight through the dense woodland, other terrain, etc.  This is overall a lighter set of rules rather than a true simulation.<br/><br/>",1991,,,

There are acceleration and maneuvering limits. Fighters are given the ability to alter facing somewhat independently of velocity, which affects combat - there is a section of invented maneuver combinations such as the &quot;Cauchy Spiral.&quot;<br/><br/>The campaign game can be facilitated by a moderator, who creates a map and adjudicates the moves. There are rules for production, planetary invasion, and fairly complex rules for ship design if players do not like the twenty or so provided.<br/><br/>According to the rules, the game was originally &quot;a set of guidelines for a computer simulation,&quot; which is apparent from the amount of arithmetic involved. In addition to the rulebook, counters, base ships (which must be cut out), and fighter sighting templates (ditto), the game includes an order sheet of programs for Texas Instruments calculators which would implement various game calculations.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

18353,The Art of Wargaming,[],"['Book', 'Wargame']","The idea of turning the violence of war into a game seems self-contradictory, yet despite this fundamental contradiction, or perhaps even because of it, games about war continue to grow in popularity. Until now, however, books on the subject have focused either on the recreational side of wargaming or on its military application. Here, Peter Perla presents the first genuine synthesis of both aspects, drawing on his own longtime experiences as a gaming hobbyist and a professional wargamer, in the U.S. defense community. Such a dual, inside perspective is unique among authors and enables him to offer a thorough evaluation of the two arenas, their similarities and differences and their influence on each other.<br/><br/>This book provides the most comprehensive and coherent discussion and analysis of wargaming ever written. Avoiding the sensationalism and superficiality of other works on the subject, it carefully explains the nature of the tool - the wargame - and the process of using it - wargaming. It argues for a better balance between professional realism and hobby playability and for increased cross-fertilization to educate and enlighten users.<br/><br/>Perla looks first at the history of wargaming in both its hobby and professional incarnations, and especially at its use by the Naval War College. He then draws on historical experience to define the fundamental principles of what wargaming is, and what it is not, and describes the subjects that wargaming is most useful for exploring. He also suggests how best to take advantage of its capabilities and downplay its limitiations. Finally, he examines current trends in wargaming in light of those historical perspectives and theoritical principles and projects into the future.<br/><br/>",1990,,,

Wherever people gather, competition - and love of competition - appear.<br/><br/>Even the lone mind seeks the stimulus of games, and in a sense the opponent is still the same. It is always fickle Fate - or our own limitations! - that we are trying to defeat. Games rise and fall in popularity, appear and disappear. Inventiveness, and love of novelty, are always modifying the old and devising new. Games have lives, histories, and family trees. Few of us today have heard of the medieval mine men's morris; but millions of hours are spent on bridge, and chess, and Monopoly - and millions of dollars at poker or roulette. This book covers games that the reader will have seen or heard about - family games and social games, games played for fun, and games played for profit. But it includes, too, many that will be strange: games from foreign countries and ancient times. All are presented through a unique blend of text and illustration. Here the reader can learn not only the secrets of bridge or chemin de fer, but also how to play pachisi or nyout, lasca, or hex, or go. In addition to clearcut, concise rules, the players and equipment each game needs are listed, while the guide on pages 316-317 groups games together according to the number of participants they require. With a little thought, then, it is easy to arrange and even improvise to try an unfamiliar game - whether to make a party go, or to keep a houseful of children quiet! This book will tempt the reader to relax and experiment. It will let him soon settle those old rules disputes. It will be a friendly guide to those games that &quot;everyone else seems to know&quot;. We believe that it is unique - a unique aid to leisure. It is, in fact, the major reference book of how to play the games of the world.&quot;<br/><br/>",1975,,,

18356,Knights and Knaves,"['Area Movement', 'Simulation']","['Medieval', 'Negotiation', 'Territory Building', 'Wargame']","From the box &amp; introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Knights and Knaves is a game for four or more players. It simulates, in a general way, the intricate relationships of the lords and vassals of a large, loosely organized Empire located somewhere in Central Europe during the High Middle Ages (ca. 1200-1400). The players try to gain wealth, power and rank while building smaller, more cohesive kingdoms within the Empire for themselves. The game contains a complete and fairly simple set of basic rules and a considerable number of optional rules. These permit infinite variations. A game usually takes from one and a half to two hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/>  Soldiery Payment - players pay the rental for the mercenary companies they control; those he is unable to pay he must auction off; any unowned mercenary companies are auctioned<br/>  Movement and Combat - You must have the permission of a realm's owner in order to move troops through it. Movement into a realm whose owner has refused you permission constitutes an attack on that realm.<br/>  Taxation - players receive taxes from realms they hold; an optional rule allows for tax gouging and revolts<br/>  Election - If either or both the offices of Emperor and Patriarch are vacant, an election is held for each vacant office. Any player who receives at least a third of the votes in an election gains the office; thus there might be as many as three Emperors or Patriarchs; if no player gets at least a third of the votes, the office remains empty.<br/><br/>The map shows only the Empire's political divisions - there is no terrain. It looks like an island, as nothing beyond the Imperial boundaries is shown. The Empire is made up of 68 realms, 60 of which are actually shown on the map (with such colorful names as The Aylemark, The League of Urf Durfal[Gerg Costikyan is listed among the play testers], the Kingdom of Hydanderabad, the Barony of Pfennig-Halfpfennig, the County of Pollenzo-Montenevoso...).  There are six extinct realms; if the player holding the title to an extinct realm gains control of all the realms that make it up, he may revive it, gaining its income, electoral votes and militia.  The two remaining realms are the Empire itself (held by the Emperor) and the Patrimony of Polykarp (held by the Patriarch, head of the Imperial Church). The Emperor can issue the Imperial Ban, and the Patriarch can excommunicate players. The game effect of both of these actions is to force the affected player to make a roll to see whether he can collect some, none or all of his revenues during each taxation period until the ban or excommunication is lifted.<br/><br/>Players perform game actions in order of the precedence of their highest title. The current Emperor goes first, followed by the Patriarch, then Kings and on down through the ranks to the Lord Mayors of free cities. When players' highest ranks are identical, then their second highest ranks are compared, and, if necessary, lesser ranks. Electors have precedence over non-electors, so an Elector-Duke would have precedence over a non-elector Duke.<br/><br/>The basic game has two types of troops: Militia Levies and Mercenary Companies.  Milita are not represented by counters on the map, and only fight in their home realms.  There are 20 mercenary companies, with names like O'Malleys Lancers, The Baratarian Archers, Gustodud's Free Companions, The Titanian Guards and Redmohr's Pikes. All but seven are &quot;venture companies;&quot; they have a home realm, and the current lord of that realm (who isn't necessarily the same person who employs them) may veto their use in combat. The rest are free companies, which may always be used in combat without restriction. There is also an optional rule for Regular Soldiery, which are recruited from realms under a player's control. Like mercenaries, these are represented by counters on the map and may move.<br/><br/>Combat is unusual in that troops are never eliminated. If a player's army is defeated, he must pay ransom for his troops; if unable to play, the opposing player captures and gains control of them. The loser may also be forced to retreat; if unable to retreat, he must pay double the ransom. If the player's noble is present, ransom is also doubled. If a noble is captured (due to being unable to pay ransom), the capturing player &quot;may do as he wishes to the prisoner, including allowing him to be ransomed, selling him to another player, or murdering him.&quot; A noble who dies is succeeded by his heir, who inherits all lands not held as fiefs from other players, all his troops and half his treasury.<br/><br/>Negotiation is encouraged. &quot;The players may negotiate anything and everything within the framework of the rules.&quot; Players may sell, lend or lease their troops, and may sell realms or grant them to other players as fiefs.<br/><br/>Victory is determined in three categories - Most Powerful(most troops), Most Noble(most titles), and Richest - so there can be as many as three winners<br/><br/>Some of the optional rules: single combat, mutinous mercenaries, assassination and conspiracy, plague, special events and even magic.<br/><br/>It is also recommended as being suitable for the background of a miniatures campaign in the medieval or Renaissance period.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case Guildford some 30 miles South West of London.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6.  When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes.  If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series.  Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies.  This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own.  It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>-    After a set time.<br/>-    When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>-    When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate.

Each figure represents one person.<br/><br/>Each player controls one &quot;unit&quot; of 20 figures and is given one 52-card deck of ordinary playing cards, which are used instead of dice in this game.  Each unit has one chit (or 3x5 card) used to determine activation randomly in a given turn.<br/><br/>Units are distinguished by a bar of color on the base: since ten players can be playing at once, and there are no uniforms in that era, this is important.  A number of stripes (from 0 to 3) on the color bar shows the morale level of the figure, from militia to average to proven veteran to elite veteran (leader).  This is important both in melee combat and morale checks.<br/><br/>Pigs are a frequent goal of a given scenario, hence the name of the game.  In fact, different units are given different objectives in a raid scenario, though things don't always work out the way one intends ... it can get a bit chaotic.<br/><br/>Cards are used to determine all random events: missile fire, combat, rallying, morale checks, etc.  The system is very easy to understand and there is very little in terms of a player aid needed.  The only downside to the card method is that a player goes through his entire deck before reshuffling, and if he notices all the good cards have been used early, it may change his tactics half way through the game as he becomes more conservative ...<br/><br/>Overall, a good light system, more for &quot;fun&quot; gaming than serious gaming.<br/><br/>",1991,,,

18472,The Complete Wargames Handbook,[],"['Book', 'Wargame']","From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Wargaming has had a remarkable four decades. Commercial wargames first appeared in the late 1950s, although commercial miniatures and naval gaming date back to the end of the 19th century. Board wargaming had something of a golden age in the 1970s, before being replaced by fantasy role playing games (RPGs) and computer games in the 1980s. In the 1990s computer wargames were covered in glitz, simplified and made into a mass market product. Many of the 70s era grognards don't recognize these games as wargames, but they are. And simple, glitzy wargames are the future. Not entirely, of course, there is also developing a via web based market for lower budget, but more accurate and detailed historical wargames. We'll never get back to the 70s, but with wargames established as a permanent part of the commercial gaming landscape, we can expect an unending stream of new and innovative ideas.&quot;<br/><br/>The first edition was published in 1980 by William Morrow.  The second edition was published in 1992, also by William Morrow (under various imprints, it appears).  <br/>The third edition (titled just &quot;Wargames Handbook&quot;) was published in 2000 by iUniverse.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

There have been four major campaigns, of which those of 1967 and 1973 - the so-called 'Six Days' and 'Yom Kippur' Wars - are of particular interest to wargamers as they involved the largest tank battles since World War 2. Israeli Centurions, Pattons and M-60s vie for battlefield supremacy with Arab T-54s and T-62s, and the arena has become a testing ground for new weapon systems and tactical doctrines while retaining an overall similarity to the armoured conflict of World War 2 which forms the subject matter of earlier books in this series.<br/><br/>This book begins with an introduction to the subject, a short chapter on the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and a detailed description, with maps, of the 1967 and 1973 campaigns. There are two detailed chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured fighting vehicles and their characteristics, anti-tank missiles, conventional artillery, infantry weapons, tactical missiles, minefields and helicopters. There are also chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured organisation and tactics, and two specially commissioned sections on the war in the air by Mike Spick, author of Air Battles in Miniature. Finally, there are detailed playing rules, an appendix listing model suppliers, a technical glossary and an index, making this the ideal book for the increasing numbers of wargamers interested in this fascinating arena.<br/><br/>",1978,,,

You have in your possession a kit that allows you to simulate the magic circle accurate with all the specifics needed for the hour of casting according to traditional rituals.<br/><br/>You have further a ritual made of authentic, traditional passages of the textbooks of magic.<br/><br/>It is precisely from such elements that the tradition of magic and spirit conjuration have been derived.<br/><br/>The makers of this kit have been concerned only to explain the principle parts and demonstrate how the magic tradition is used. The consequences of performing the ritual are dependent upon the psychic awareness level and skill of the performer.  It is here recognized that persons vary as to their level of psychic awareness and belief in spirit worlds.<br/><br/>No claims are made with this kit as to results.  The ritual has been modified to assure beneficial spirits. Use of the kits for other purposes is beyond control of the maker.<br/><br/>Use the kit in fun and stay within the confines of the spirit indicated.  These spirits are good and will serve you well.  And, you may have fun as your mind and spirit relate to these forces.<br/><br/>Convert the image to malevolent spirits at your risk.

Each book has been placed precisely in the pit, positioned according to exacting rituals; their function to prevent chaos from emerging from the pit. The Keeper is entrusted to stop the souls of the damned from escaping - something they attempt continuously - by touring the labyrinth and keeping the power contained in the books strong enough to seal the abyss. Only the Keeper knows the rituals and the exact position of every volume as he&rsquo;s the sole person with access to the Sator secrets.<br/><br/>SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS is the seal that keeps the souls of the damned from flowing away...<br/><br/>But the power of the old Keeper is waning, and the sinners&rsquo; pit has felt this, using the breath of the damned to slowly shift the volumes which compose the Sator across the labyrinth in order to open a passage for their souls into our world.<br/><br/>Thus, the four Acolytes of the Keeper have been entrusted to recover the holy books that have been moved across the labyrinth. Each volume contains a key which lets one understand some of the arcane words of the Sator and thereby regain control of the labyrinth. The Acolyte who first recovers the four holy books that the Keeper has asked him to find will be able to access the Sator and become the new Keeper.<br/><br/>Goal<br/><br/>Each player represents an Acolyte and tries to be the first to recover the four books that the Keeper has entrusted to him (the four books in the color of his pawn). <br/>The sinners&rsquo; pit is an intricate labyrinth of Footbridges and mobile walkways that can be moved by gears and pulleys. They can be turned and pushed in order to create a safe path over which the Acolyte may safely walk the abyss.<br/><br/>To move Footbridges, each Acolyte may read from the book Incertus Movet in Aere Sospeso', which is a kind of user&rsquo;s manual explaining how to manipulate the walking passages to meet his needs. The more Footbridges the Acolyte moves during his turn, the farther he will be able to walk.<br/>What&rsquo;s more, he will be able to use the content of his own Liber Fidei, a set of prayers, thoughts and ascetic books, to perform apparently impossible actions (such as the manipulation of time and space) thanks to the power of his faith...<br/><br/>",2008,,,

With 2 players one must place 7 buildings in order to win (there are 13 spaces). With 3-4 players one must achieve at least 12 points to be the winner. Each round is divided into three phases.<br/><br/>In the first phase each player decides the number of steps that he wants to move one of his building. Accordingly it takes and puts as many Oracle stones into its right hand, while keeping the remaining Oracle stones covered in the left hand. Every player place a bet on the total amount of Oracle stones that will be played in the current round by all players (it's not permitted to call a number already called by a previous player). After each player called a value, everyone open their right hand, and if someone called the exact value, he will have benefits in the third phase.<br/><br/>In the second phase every player moves one of his buildings (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) according to number of Oracle stones played. During the movement one can jump over one or more buildings, but the target field must be however free. If one jumps over an opponent building with the next to last point of movement, he can strike this at the end of its movement, if he wants to. The building is then put again into the supply of the opponent.<br/><br/>In the third phase only the player that called exactly the value in the first phase can place one of its temple on a free starting position on the board. If all starting positions are occupied or if the player has already all temples on the board, the action is not taken.<br/><br/>",1993,,,

18589,Sextett,['Dice Rolling'],['Abstract Strategy'],"Sextett is a collection of 6 abstract strategy games packaged in one box.

Ravensburger catalog #12.026<br/><br/>The game box includes several sets of multi colored pawns used in all games and 3 double sided hard playing boards.<br/><br/>The games included are:<br/><br/>Quicki - a dice rolling race game where players move around an abstract grid of points trying to reach their colored places in the board center, players can be sent back to their starting places by other players choosing to land on their current position.<br/><br/>Ponte - from the translated rulebook: The object of the game is to reach the island by crossing streets and bridges with one figure as fast as possible and then build a tower and reach it by jumps.<br/><br/>The Magic Star - The object of the game is to try to move clockwise around the star on the outer or inner path beginning from the starting point.  The player who manages to get all of his game figures into his own star corner first wins the game.  A blockade figure constantly changes the aspect of the game.<br/><br/>Piggy Back - The object of the game is to get all the figures across the board first, whereby the players are forced at times to carry the opponent's figures &quot;piggy-back&quot; across the board or even to be carried in the same way themselves in order to reach their destination.  The point of the game is to try to take advantage of the piggy back rule whenever possible.<br/><br/>Fox Jumping - A gathering of foxes (2 or 4 fox families make 40 foxes) is disturbed by a hunting party.  Hastily each fox tried to hide in one of the 39 neighboring dens.  But since there is room for one fox in each den, the slowest fox loses the race.<br/><br/>Surakarta - This game originated in Indonesia.   It bears the name of the old time-honored city of Surakarta on the island of Middle Java.  The game is played on a grid of points with all points on the outer edge connected by a curved line that leads back to another board edge.  The idea is to move your pawns around the grid trying to get to a curved line that can be used to move to another side of the board and more importantly eliminate your opponents pawn.  The game is played actively in Indonesia by drawing lines in the ground and playing with pebbles.<br/><br/>",1969,,,

To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.<br/><br/>The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.<br/><br/>As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Physics-based systems model aircraft performance differences correctly and simply through the use of only two elegant playaids; graphical computers known as nomograms. Missiles fly out towards their targets without player intervention, using proper kinematics from launch and flowing seamlessly into the underlying flight engine. The core of Birds of Prey is the PHAD - the Pitch, Heading, and Attitude Display, a simple tool allowing players to track their the orientation of an aircraft in three dimensions. The PHAD makes it trivial to find the relative position (bearings) and relative motion between maneuvering aircraft. It also makes figuring blind spots where you can't sight other aircraft a trivial exercise, regardless of whether the aircraft is flying straight and level, has its nose pointing straight up, or is in the middle of a wingover.<br/><br/>The lavishly illustrated Birds of Prey tutorial guides you through learning the game solo, while the rulebook is a reference for rules questions only. The play aids are built to keep the rulebook in the box during play. Laminated play-aids use a system of hints that lead players through flight and eases return to play. Full-color box-miniatures are placed on tilt-blocks and stacking tiles showing altitude, pitch, roll and heading and bringing the three-dimensional fight to life.<br/><br/>",2008,,,

Only one jump is made (no chain jumping), and missed opportunities to jump may be forced by the opponent, although a player is free to choose among several available jumps. Blockading all of the opposing pieces is not allowed, although some may be temporarily blocked as long as the opponent still has a legal move.<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first player to move all of his pieces seven rows ahead - i.e. into the starting places of the opposing piece. However, the order from left to right and front to back should be kept. Thus, reading from left to right, the goal position is one through five suns (tenth rank), one through five moons (ninth rank) and one through five stars (eighth rank). The player first achieving this position wins by as many points as the number of moves opponent would need to achieve his goal position.<br/><br/>If neither player reaches the goal position by the time 120 moves have been made by each player, the score is calculated as the difference between the number of moves each player would need to reach the goal position, as if the board were clear of opposing pieces.<br/><br/>",1899,,,

You you can play over the story from about the first 100 novellas issued. The game is broken up in different phases which you can play separately or one after another for a very long game. The phases with different backsides are:<br/><br/>Phase I: Die Dritte Macht (The Third Power, 1996)<br/>Phase II/III: Topsider &amp; Springer (1996)<br/>Phase IV: Vorsto&szlig; nach Arkon (Approach to Arkon, 1997)<br/>Phase V: Atlan &amp; Arkon (2003)<br/><br/>Fanpro canceled the game in 1998. Finally Between The Stars (a company founded by fans of the game) took over and released phase V in 2003.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins this complex game. You get victory points for completing phases and for completing side plots. Only after a phase is completed the players can draw cards from the next phase (you need separate decks for each phase you will play).<br/><br/>The cards show different planets, star systems, mutants with psi-talents, other persons, troops, spaceships, fleets, accessories, event cards and galactic riddles. There is also an action card deck to randomize the fights someway.<br/><br/>Every card can be &quot;Pro&quot;, &quot;Anti&quot;, or both (&quot;Dual&quot;). In a game you have to play two sides at the same time, the pro-side (the good guys) and the anti-side (the bad boys). After you have built up your fleets and armies (you normally hide them below other cards) you fight space fights and invasions on enemy planets: With your anti-side you attack the pro-sides of your opponents, and with your pro-side you damage their anti-sides.<br/><br/>",1996,,,

The three game scales allow experimentation with games of different scopes and scales  with existing troops and mounting systems.  All three scales use the same basing system; there is no need for rebasing.<br/><br/>Les Grognards 2nd Edition also includes Horizon Movement rules for the Battalion and Grand Tactical scale games.  Horizon Movement eliminates virtually all measuring for movement.  Horizon movement allows units to move based on the tabletop terrain and enemy unit's positions.  Rather than measuring moves in small increments, moves are  made based on limiting terrain or tactical situations.  The result is a game that features dynamic, flowing movement rather than the same moves broken down into small increments as in standard measured movement games.<br/><br/>Les Grognards 2nd edition features completely new material, incorporating 5 sets of rules (Company scale, Battalion scale, Grand Tactical scale, Horizon Movement Battalion scale, Horizon Movement Grand Tactical scale) and 37 different army lists.

In many cases the &quot;winners&quot; would be surprised if they returned today to view modern South Africa, Egypt, China, or Morocco.

18710,Piquet: Point of Attack II – The Blitzkrieg,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling']","['Expansion for Base-game', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","The Blitzkrieg is unique in the Piquet system in that it has three different game scales included.  The different game scales allow for a wide variety of scenarios, game sizes, and game types.<br/><br/>The Game Scale Rules section includes unique rules for each of the three scale games included in the The Blitzkrieg game supplement (Squad, Platoon, and Battalion).  Each game scale has its own Weapon Adjustment Table, game play reference sheet, quick rating BDV Tables, and organizational information.<br/><br/>This allows a gamers to play everything from a vicious, house-to-house skirmish combat to a multi-division, multi-day battle on the plains of Russia.  The movement, combat, and morale sections of the rules were deliberately developed to fit the &quot;zoom&quot; concept mentioned in the original Piquet rules.  By using a few unique rules, and different troop ratings, a gamer can easily move between the three scales.  The basic rule mechanics are the same, only the details change.  The Squad scale game is new with this version of the rules.  It allows for large skirmish actions, instead of the small, highly individually personalized game typical of skirmish rules.  The Squad game allows skirmish detail in games with a platoon or more of infantry on a side.   The detail players enjoy in skirmish games is still there, but it is imbedded in the game system.  As an example, it would be very easy to just add rules to the basic rule skeleton to handle unique cases.  Consider armor in a skirmish game.   Obviously, there is a difference in the combat readiness of a tank that is buttoned up compared to one which is just moving down a road.  The Squad game easily handles this difference by requiring that vehicles be in a declared status - either march or deployed.  March status indicates a tank or vehicle that is not combat ready, but is primarily intent on moving rapidly.  Deployed status indicates a tank or vehicles that is tactically aware prepared for the uncertainties of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",2004,,,

At the beginning of the seventeenth century armies deployed in large units comprising many thousands of men. Firepower, while important, was still subordinate to shock of contact and the use of pole arm weapons. The period can be characterized: - The introduction of smaller formations, reduction in the use of pike and increased reliance on firepower and the development of linear tactics. Anchor of Faith allows the gamer to recreate the battles and tactics of this colorful period.<br/><br/>Anchor of Faith covers warfare in Europe and the fringe nations in the Middle East and Asia. The supplement introduces new rule mechanisms, formation types and army generation tables particular to the period 1600 to 1690. It combines the main rules that allow battles to be played at a regimental scale, and a sub set of rules, the Twelve Apostles, for fighting smaller actions with units typically representing a few companies of infantry or troops of cavalry. The latter being particularly useful for fighting large English Civil War skirmishes.<br/><br/>Anchor of Faith includes a range of new formations definitions including tercios, Swedish brigade, deep line, caracole cavalry, commanded shot, galloper cavalry and war wagons. New period rule mechanisms are introduced to mirror both the abilities and shortcomings of the troops of this era. New rules include revised pursuit rules, morale points by command and new fire rules to reflect the low effect of musketry and the importance of  &lsquo;push of pike&rsquo; in deciding the outcome of engagements.

If one is looking for a variety of unit types, tactical doctrine, or weaponry, medieval/renaissance warfare has much to offer.  If one wants colorful dress and dramatic costumes, then the Landtsknecht and the Ottoman Janissaries are but a few of the many available troops.   Even more appealing is that this is a period of fascinating transitions in the practice of warfare.<br/><br/>Two of the greatest transitional effects are the introduction and growing effectiveness of gunpowder weapons, both in the form of artillery, as well as personal weapons, and the ability for nations to field semi-national armies.  The creation of these larger forces and their supply was a necessary social foundation for the Military Revolution that allowed the great armies of the 17th century and later.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",2004,,,
18713,Grand Piquet,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling']","['Miniatures', 'Napoleonic', 'Wargame']","Grand Piquet 2nd Edition - Many changes were made for this new edition of Grand Piquet.  The Army commander now plays a more pivotal role in the command and control of a Corps.  These formations no longer move whenever or wherever they wish.    A D12 is now the basis for all initiative rolls, which effectively eliminates the need for phases, as well as mitigates the wild swings in initiative.    The Sequence decks have been radically altered. Now there are Action cards, by type of unit [e.g. Infantry Action card], whereby there is much greater flexibility in actions taken by units.  Also, the basic Sequence deck is now made up of 20 cards, instead of 28.  The combat system is based primarily on Target type, so there are fewer modifiers to calculate. The basic concept of &ldquo;chipping&rdquo; within the morale system is intact, yet there is no need to keep track of morale chips. Unit / sub unit designations are determined by numbers of men and not by regiment.  Players determine the size and make up of a unit, thereby effectively tailoring each Command Group to a particular situation or task.  These are but a few of the changes that have been made. <br/>It is hoped that this new edition will keep the flavor and excitement of the original, while improving the mechanics, which will give a more fluid, less static feel to the game.  One final comment that deserves remembering:  Piquet is an innovative system designed to give players the opportunity to make command decisions based upon finite resources.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Sun Tzu and his Wu soldiers were outnumbered and King Shao's armies held the high ground. Sun Tzu feigned retreat and tricked King Shao into spreading out his forces, ready to pursue. With the Ch'u scattered, Sun Tzu crushed their forces in piecemeal fashion at the battle of Bai Ju, routing the Ch'u back to their capital of Ying. King Shao fled Ying seeking refuge and asylum across the borders while Sun Tzu remained the master of strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In Sun Tzu, a.k.a. Dynasties, players take on the role of Sun Tzu or King Shao, leading these two opposing armies in an attempt to unify China through the deployment of their armies and forces rather than by brute force. Each turn players play cards to specific provinces, then reveal them individually by province. Armies are added or removed from the province depending on who played the higher valued card or who played a special card. Some cards can only be used once, so playing the card at the correct time is critical to a winning strategy. The game has a feel of &quot;tug-of-war&quot; as the scoring marker starts in the middle of the scoring scale and the players attempt to move the marker to their side of the track. The game ends after nine rounds or if either player is able to move the scoring marker to the last space on his side of the scoring track.<br/><br/>",2005,,,
18746,Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Pike and Shot', 'Wargame']","Part of Ben Hull's award-winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles series.<br/><br/>The fourth installment in this series is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the career of one of the Great Captains of History, King Gustav II Adolf the Great of Sweden. In his brief career, he catapulted Sweden to the forefront of European power politics. This volume sets it focus on the rise and climax of Gustav Adolf's military system.<br/><br/>The series began with the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War, then covered the Swedish army after Gustav Adolf in Sweden Fights On, then looked at the rise of the French in the Thirty Years War in Under the Lily Banners. In this volume the Swedish face the tough Polish cavalry, lance equipped winged Husars and Cossacks. The Swedish-style brigades also take on the unbeaten Tilly at the head of the allied Catholic League and Imperial armies. Finally, Wallenstein, with a resurgent Imperial army, mastered the art of drawing out the Swedes to attack on ground of his choosing.<br/><br/>In each battle included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms, armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player who can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions or brigades, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, Cavalry Pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The battles included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms are:<br/><br/>Dirschau 1627 - The Prussian campaign that started in 1626, Gustav Adolf had finally brought the Poles to the field and defeated them in battle at Gniew a month before, skillfully using terrain to offset the powerful Polish Hussars. Again the King faced the Polish General Koniecpolski and sought to the same again.<br/><br/>Breitenfeld 1631 - The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War<br/><br/>Alte Veste 1632 - The late summer saw the Swedish besieged by Wallenstein at N&uuml;rnberg.<br/><br/>L&uuml;tzen 1632 - Southeast of Leipzig the Swedes caught up to the Imperial main body. Wallenstein's army had detached two corps and was serious danger. He fortified a position at L&uuml;tzen. King Gustav Adolf's final battle.<br/><br/>Honigfelde / Trzciano 1629 - &quot;I've never had a hotter bath!&quot; exclaimed Gustav II Adolf upon his return. Very nearly captured while trying to extricate his army from a Polish and Imperial trap, this great cavalry battle showed the Poles were to be treated with respect. Rheingraf Otto Ludwig's German cavalry attacked the advancing Poles and was drawn into a pincer. Gustav Adolf rushed forward to save the impetuous Rheingraf. Koniecpolski showed his cunning. The Imperial contingent joined the fray and sent the Swedes falling back. The Imperial commander, von Arnim, would take the field with Gustav Adolf at Breitenfeld two years later.<br/><br/>Components: <br/>3 Full-color countersheets<br/>Two 22&quot;x34&quot; back-printed maps <br/>Rulebook <br/>Scenario/Playbook<br/>2 11x17&quot; Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>",2006,,,
18747,Onward Christian Soldiers: The Crusades,"['Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement']","['Medieval', 'Wargame']","(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Onward Christian Soldiers is Richard Berg's newest strategic level game, this one focused on one of, if not THE, central events in the Middle Ages - The Crusades. It will allow gamers to replay not only the first three Crusades - the only 3 that focused on what we call The Middle East - but with scenarios that range from a 7-player version of the 1st Crusade to a 3rd Crusade scenario that supposes Frederick Barbarossa didn't drown in Turkey and his immense army reached the Kingdom of Jerusalem pretty much intact.<br/><br/>Onward Christian Soldiers uses numerous innovative mechanics, including: <br/><br/>    an Activation system that allows players to choose which leaders/armies they want to use most in a given turn, but not know when they will be available for such use.<br/>    a Movement system with no Movement Allowances or Costs, but a heavy emphasis on Attrition and the ability of commanders to &quot;keep going&quot;. Shop 'til ya Drop . . . <br/>    Combat mechanics that put a major, detailed emphasis on sieges and ravaging the surrounding areas, but still allow for the predilections of the various armies in field battles (such as the famous Frankish Heavy Cavalry Charge), as well as the abilities of their commanders . . . men like the great initial Crusaders, such as Raymond, Bohemond, Godfrey and Tancred, King Louis VII of France (and his troublesome wife, the famous Eleanor of Aquitaine), Frederick Barbarossa (if he stays away from the pool), the dangerous Nur ad-Din, the magnificent Saladin, and the one Christian the Muslims feared more than anyone, Richard Lionheart.<br/>    Movement and attrition go hand in hand in this game. Leaders may move as far as they want<br/>    The game uses three sets of cards (110 cards total). Each of the four Crusader factions -- Northern Franks, Southern Franks, Sicilian Normans, Germans -- and three Muslim factions -- Northern Syrians, Southern Syrians, Mosul Turks -- has three or four Leader cards, which the players secretly &quot;purchase&quot; at the beginning of the Game-Turn to create the Activation Deck that determines which leader goes next. In addition, there are two Event Decks - one for the Crusaders and one for the Muslims -- through which a variety of random events occur, ranging from taking cities via treachery to suffering added attrition through oppressive heat.<br/>    Normally, each Leader controls armies only from its own faction. However, a simple set of multi-faction rules controls situations in which either side wishes to combine their armies into larger forces, mostly for the sake of sieges against major cities. The Siege of Antioch, which usually happens early in the game, often requires such an army. The multi-faction rules particularly come into their own during multi-player games; here you can expect to see players bickering over who controls the combined forces, an important point considering that whoever is in charge when the city falls gains control over the city. If attacked while combined, the players of a multi-faction force have 30 seconds to decide who's in charge: if they don't, they defend using a mediocre formation.<br/><br/><br/>COUNTERS: 876 full color counters<br/>MAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color map<br/>CARDS: 110 Cards<br/>OTHER:<br/><br/>     Two six-sided dice<br/>     First Crusade Rule book<br/>     Second and Third Crusade Rule book<br/>     Playbook<br/>     4 Player Aid cards <br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER Richard Berg<br/>DEVELOPER Neil Randall<br/>ART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

18748,Unhappy King Charles!,"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement']","['Civil War', 'Pike and Shot', 'Wargame']","Unhappy King Charles! allows two players to decide whether Commons or Cavalier shall rule in England. Both seek to establish control over the country and of its economic structures. They seek not only to defeat their opponents in battle but also to seize control of the local government of England and Wales.<br/><br/>The game is based on We the People, Mark Herman's ingenious game on a later rebellion. As the organization of armies and states was often desultory, the cards do not provide a wide range of choices (as in Paths of Glory). The players in Unhappy King Charles! must make do with what they have. The three decks of cards - Early(1642-1643), Middle(1644) and Late (1645)- have been developed to give the correct feel for the early, middle and late war, based on storyboarding techniques. As befits a Civil War, there is treachery, bravery and stupidity in the events on the cards.<br/><br/>Unhappy King Charles! is played over eleven turns, each representing about four months. Brigades of troops are used to form Armies (defined Rule 3) or garrisons of fortresses (Rule 13). Only unled Brigades are on the map; the others are placed on the box of their General on the Command Displays. Generals move on the maps.<br/><br/>The Armies of Unhappy King Charles! are temporary massings of troops that have as much to do with feudal armies as modern revolutionaries. With inadequate supply and poor equipment it is not surprising that these armies suffer from continual desertion; and in using them you are going to have to ensure they wander the map collecting fresh recruits. Armies can be over 30,000 for a vital siege or battle or 3,000 tough cavalry under Prince Rupert or Black Tom Fairfax.<br/><br/>Movement activations are initiated via a numbered Ops Card, as in We the People, and are based on Army size. The smaller the Army the faster it can move. Movement across the map is by means of Areas joined by movement lines. Control of areas can change during movement if movement points are spent. Non-moving Armies can attempt interception, placing themselves in the path of the moving Army to cause Battle.<br/><br/>The game's basic combat unit is the Brigade, which comes in two types: Veterans (value 2) and militia (value 1). Usually militia units must be recruited before veterans of that Region. Each Region's Areas and Brigades use the same basic colour system. Fresh Brigades are received by Recruitment, which is usually limited to the unit's region of origin. Brigades lost in combat are not available for recruitment (though some Event Cards can bring them back); other losses are available.<br/><br/>Leader counters are either Generals (with a Strategic and Battle Rating) or Local Notables (Governors of fortresses). Generals can be Field Generals (who operate everywhere) or Regional Generals who can suffer disadvantages when outside their Region. Generals cannot transfer Brigades to other Generals (unless Event Cards require), Brigades remain with their original General until death, dispersal or desertion takes them. Local Notables can transfer Brigades to other friendly Generals.<br/><br/>Battles use the Combat Value of Brigades, General's Battle Ratings and Combat Cards to resolve combat. But before any Battle is fought one side can try to Evade (leave the Area) or Disperse (remove itself before combat). Losses in combat are not available for recruitment. Drawn and Decisive Victories will kill Veteran Brigades (if there are any) first. The loser must retreat and can suffer further losses if he retreats through enemy PC Markers. Major and Decisive Victories earn extra Cards.<br/><br/>Fortresses cover a wide range of locations. They are ranked by class and must be forced to Surrender by Siege or Event Card. Siege requires the attention of an Army for some time (most Fortresses will require more than one activation to capture). If attacked during that time the besieger can have to abandon the Siege. Assaults can be attempted (at a cost in losses).<br/><br/>The game can be won by an Automatic Victory, by one side failing to control enough Areas, or at the end of the eleventh turn.<br/><br/>For those players who like some counter-factuals a pack of would-be events is provided. Now players can use Dutch squadrons to blockade the King, summon the Duke of Lorraine, or cause a rising in London. As an Optional Rule, four events are drawn each game and shuffled into the middle and late decks.<br/><br/>Cover artwork inspired by Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641)<br/><br/>",2008,,,

A massive, swirling cavalry battle so large that one wing never knew what was happening on the other wing, a factor which led to the Mongol downfall.<br/><br/>Mansourah brings in what many gamers have been waiting for: a full-blown Crusader army. This time its that of Louis IX, invading Egypt for a second time, advancing up The Nile only to get stopped by the Mamluks of the last-gasp Abbuyid Dynasty outside their brand-new city, Mansourah. Not only do we have 3 &quot;battles&quot; of Crusader heavy cavalry - acting as so many of their bretheren too often did throughout these wars - but lots of crossbows, field artillery, and even street fighting.<br/><br/><br/>Designed by Richard Berg and Developed by Al Ray, Mamluk contains one full map, one sheet of counters, and all rules needed for these two scenarios.

To show a card a player takes a card out of is hand and places it on the table in front of him, it still belongs to him.

To Combine, a player may take one card from his hand and combine it with one of his show cards, combine two of his show cards, combine one of his show cards with an active card, or two active cards.  Only cards whose colors are one color apart on the color wheel may be combined.  For example red and blue makes magenta, and blue and cyan makes green.  To Take cards, a player takes one of his show cards (or a combination as if it were the combined color) and an active card, (or combination) and puts them aside for scoring at the end of the round.  To take, the colors must be exactly opposite on the color wheel, for example a blue show card (or magenta, cyan combination) takes yellow active card (or red, green combination).<br/><br/>Advanced rules allow combining more than two cards to make combinations, thus yellow combined with a blue/red combination (as if it were magenta) makes red.<br/><br/>Although the number of players is stated as 2 to 6, there is no five player version.

Drawing on his own experience with Chess and Xiang-Qi, Demian came up with Congo in just over an hour's time. Games tend to be fairly quick and bloody.<br/><br/>Set on an African Savannah with a river running horizontally across the board, the central royal piece is, of course, a lion, and a player wins by capturing the opposing lion. Lions move by stepping one space in any direction, but (except to capture the opposing lion for the win, which it can do by facing the opposing lion on an open file) is confined to the three-by-three area in the middle of its side of the board.<br/><br/>Reading the initial setup across the first rank, there is a zebra that moves and captures like a Chess knight. Next is a crocodile that can move and capture by stepping one space in any direction or may race all the way to the river on an open file or may swim horizontally within the river along its entire unobstructed length. Next comes an elephant that moves and captures by jumping one or two squares orthogonally. Next is the lion, then another elephant. Next is a monkey that moves by stepping one space in any direction or captures (possibly repeatedly) by jumping over pieces by a short leap (i.e., the monkey's capturing movement is like the piece movement in Halma, but with immediate capture). Last comes the giraffe, which can jump one or two steps in any direction or capture by jumping onto pieces two spaces away in any direction. Like animals on opposing sides are lined up opposite their counterparts.<br/><br/>The second rank on each side is filled with un-promoted pawns that move and capture by stepping one space straight or diagonally forward, and may (but only from across the river) also retreat one or two spaces straight backward without capture. Pawns promote to a super-pawn upon reaching the last rank, and may additionally move and capture one space horizontally or retreat one or two spaces diagonally backward from any space on the board. Any piece except the crocodile may only stay in the river for one turn, after which it drowns if not moved further.<br/><br/>",1982,,,

The figure scale is 1:20.<br/><br/>Over the years I have used various sets of Napoleonic wargames rules &ndash; some good, others too complicated or simply not &quot;Napoleonic&quot;. Most however, were split into two very separate camps - those aimed at battalion level and those aimed at army level with little or no middle ground between the two. General de Brigade was designed to combine the appeal of battalion based games with the most important aspects of command and control from army level games. It was important therefore to base the game at the correct level within the military structure in order to achieve this. The division seemed the most suitable level.<br/><br/>When players field a division they are in command of a number of brigades and it is to this level that most wargamers are suited. This is because after spending hours researching and painting our armies we want to maneuver each and every unit, overseeing their every volley, melee and morale test, At brigade level this is exactly what is expected of the commander &ndash; he would be concerned with deployment, formation and when to fire &ndash; here formations such as column or line do matter! However the use of brigades and brigade orders introduces a command and control factor that limits the 'nippy little battalion' syndrome and restricts the wargamer from doing whatever he wants with any unit whenever it suits him.<br/><br/>General de Brigade allows wargamers the freedom to command and maneuver each battalion or squadron but also includes higher command decisions such as brigade objectives, the timing of assaults and the deployment of reserves.<br/><br/>",1998,,,

18900,Altar,"['Grid Movement', 'Slide/Push', 'Square Grid']",['Abstract Strategy'],"(Description from the box)<br/><br/>The game of strategy and wit for two players involving thirteen geometric elements and an invisible force.<br/><br/>The geometric shape of the individual playing pieces indicates how they may be moved, while maintaining a simple visual and tactile quality.<br/><br/>The invisible force relies on the imagination of the players. The concept is similar to the repelling forces between two magnets. In the game 'Altar' imaginary repelling forces exist between the different colored playing pieces.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for a player to maneuver the opposing color altar (cube) into the central recess and then to place their own templar (cone) on top of that altar (cube) to win the game.<br/><br/>The three dimensional design of the board incorporates recessed areas. These may only be crossed by the raven (hexagonal shape), which normally requires an obstacle to jump over to complete its move. The other playing pieces may only cross these areas by using an altar piece (cube) as a 'bridge' or 'stepping stone'.<br/><br/>The unique concept which controls and unifies the game enables 'Altar' with relatively few pieces to develop many permutations. Consequently a depth and level comparative to that of 'chess' can evolve with the individual.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

The British and Spanish monarchs did not reckon with the ambitions of Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor of the French. The wily Napoleon III schemed to conquer Mexico and set up a puppet regime that would bleed Mexico of its treasures to finance a resurgent French Empire.<br/><br/>Napoleon III picked an obscure Austrian archduke named Maximilian to be his cat&rsquo;s-paw and supported the effort with thousands of French troops. Even though there was some local support in Mexico for the return to a monarchy, most of the country remained loyal to the elected president, Benito Juarez and the French spent huge amounts of treasure and blood to try to put down the Republican Forces. From 1862 through 1866, Napoleon III and his puppet Maximilian attempted to forge a Mexican Empire, but after the United States won its Civil War, the threat of an invasion from the North and growing concerns about the ascendancy of the Prussian military in Europe forced Napoleon to withdraw his army from Mexico.

18916,Polemos: English Civil War,['Simulation'],"['Civil War', 'Miniatures', 'Pike and Shot', 'Wargame']","From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>During the middle years of the seventeenth century, the British Isles underwent a period of huge change, catastrophic wars and campaigns, political revolution, social upheaval political experimentation and religious ferment. It was a period when the famous and the infamous made their entries into the history books leaving their legacy and their legends. Names such as Ralph Hopton, William Waller, Prince Rupert, Thomas Fairfax, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Newcastle, Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill, The Earl of Montrose and Duke of Argyll can still evoke fierce loyalties and harsh criticism even today. The characters of those chief protagonists, King Charles I and Oliver Cromwell, are still considered, analyzed and argued over by successive generations of historians.<br/><br/>There is little surprise therefore that the English Civil War has always been a firm favorite for wargamers.<br/><br/>Polemos: English Civil War is unashamedly aimed at large scale actions. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions the size of Edgehill, Marston Moor and Naseby in an evening.<br/><br/>The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army is comprised of a number of Bases and can be built either using historical orders of battle or on Army Lists. Bases are generally grouped into Brigades. Armies can vary in size from around 15 to 50 Bases.<br/><br/>Polemos:ECW is designed to allow the player to represent an English Civil War army using a limited number of bases, each of which represents a tactical element that may act individually. Each base is designed to have enough figures on it to look like a real unit. The design focus eliminates fiddly lining up, precise numbers of figures of musketeers and pikemen etc in favour of a broader approach.<br/><br/>",2005,,,
18917,Polemos: War of the Spanish Succession,['Simulation'],"['Age of Reason', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>First of the great dynastic struggles of the eighteenth century, the War of Spanish Succession involved most of Europe. A state which did not back up its policies with troops in this period probably supplied them as mercenaries to those which did.<br/><br/>Central to the causes of conflict were the expansionist ambitions of Louis XIV, King of France, which were opposed by a series of shifting alliances. Towering over the period is the figure of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, and his close ally Prince Eugene of Savoy.<br/><br/>This is the classic campaigning period. Each year, the armies marched across Europe is a colossal chess game on a board constricted by river barriers and studded with fortresses. These manoeuvres culminated in great set-piece battles, including Marlborough&rsquo;s &lsquo;big four&rsquo;: Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet.<br/><br/>The War of Spanish Succession has much to recommend it to wargamers; uniforms were colourful (but are simple to paint.) and manoeuvres were bold and forceful. Standing armies were in their relative infancy at this time, and the period saw the founding of traditions which were to last the centuries.<br/><br/>Polemos War of Spanish Succession is specifically aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts. For instance, troops using the platoon firing system have improved close range factors, while others using fire by ranks are allowed to be more aggressive.<br/><br/>The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army consists of a number of bases, organised into Brigades and Commands, either to an historical model or by the use of army lists. The size of armies in this period varied enormously; in Polemos WoSS, a general&rsquo;s command can be from eight to 15 bases, but an army can comprise anything from two commands upwards.<br/><br/>Polemos War of Spanish Succession is designed to not only give the feel of command in the period, but also to give something of the look. The actual number or composition of figures on a base is unimportant, but it should mount enough figures to make it look like a real unit of troops. The sight of your lines of steady musketeers or massed cavalry advancing across the table should fill your opponent with awe and trepidation!<br/><br/>",2005,,,
18918,Polemos: Great Northern War,['Simulation'],"['Age of Reason', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>The early years of the eighteenth century were a time of great, and long lasting, changes in Eastern Europe. It saw two former &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers decline; for Sweden it was a cataclysmic experience as they were reduced to a small or medium power. While Poland-Lithuania started on the path that would lead to extinction later in the century. It saw two medium sized powers, Denmark and Saxony, fail in their bid to gain, or regain, &lsquo;Great&rsquo; powers status. It saw two powers rise; for Brandenburg-Prussia it was an important stepping stone to Great power status later in the century. While for Russia went from being &lsquo;an obscure barbarous nation&rsquo; to a Great power thanks to its victories<br/><br/>Polemos: Great Northern War is aimed at gaming large scale actions from this time. It is quite possible to stage, play and complete actions in an evening and even the largest action should be relatively easy to play. The emphasis is on the Great Northern War but other actions from this period can also be fought. The wars against the Ottoman Empire, the Polish Civil War and other actions in the period 1695 to 1725 may also be fought. You can be Peter the Great of Russia and face the cream of what was probably the best army in the world of this period &ndash; Charles XII Swedish army. Perhaps instead you could as Peter battle the Ottomans on the river Prut.<br/><br/>The Great Northern War has perhaps not been gamed as much as would be expected for such an important conflict with many interesting battles and armies. To a large extent this is because of the lack of information about the war and its battles. Polemos: GNW will introduce information and army lists that will rectify this. You too will be able to command the combined Saxon, Polish and Russian army at the battle of Kalisz (1706) or re-fight the Polish civil war battle of Koniecpol (1708).<br/><br/>",2005,,,

18923,Malaka,"['Dice Rolling', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Malaka is a cross between Backgammon, Plakoto and Lines of Action.  Players race to move their pieces around the board, delaying their opponent while trying to connect their pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol.  Using a familiar (Backgammon type) roll-and-move mechanism, each player attempts to form an orthogonally connected group of their pieces (as in Lines of Action) at the opposite corner of the board from their starting location.  The board is designed with two &quot;walls&quot; that force the players to navigate an &quot;S&quot; type path to reach their goal in the opposite corner.  The board consists of nine subareas, each with a basic direction of forward movement (which is, of course, opposite for the two players).<br/><br/>On their turn, each player rolls two dice (4-sided dice for the 9x9 board, 6-sided dice for the 12x12 board) and uses the resulting numbers to move their pieces.  Pieces may either step directly forwards, or jump over a wall.  If a piece steps directly forwards, then it must step in a straight line a number of spaces equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  If the piece steps onto a single enemy piece, then that enemy piece is pinned (as in Plakoto) until the player moves off.  Players may stack as many pieces as they like onto any point, but cannot move to any point at which the enemy controls a block (a pile of two or more pieces).  Alternatively, a piece may jump over a wall (ignoring the movement restrictions of the moving piece's current sub-area) if that jump lands on a single enemy piece a number of spaces away equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  The enemy piece is captured and removed from the game.  Players cannot jump backwards and cannot cross both walls with the same jump.  Jumping over a wall to capture an enemy piece is a double-edged sword: it allows the piece to push forward quickly by taking a shortcut, but also makes the opponent's task easier as they have one less piece to connect.<br/><br/>After making any move, the same piece may take further steps or jumps, possibly changing direction if the first move resulted in a change in sub-area. If a double is rolled, then the player moves four times using the pip value shown (as in Backgammon).  The player must make a move that uses the maximum possible number of pips.<br/><br/>A player wins by orthogonally connecting all of their remaining pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol (not necessarily in a single connected group, but all pieces orthogonally connected to a piece on the goal line).  A player may also win by pinning an opponent's piece on his own starting line.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

The design combines factual historical detail with educated guesswork to produce an alternative history simulation covering the period from X-Day +1 through X-Day +30. One player acts as the overall commander of the Allied invasion effort; the other takes the role of the leader of the Japanese defense force. The burden of attack is generally on the American, but both players attempt to win by controlling key terrain on the island and destroying opposing forces. A complete game of DF takes from two to four hours to complete and it's suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>The approach we've taken here is called, among those who deal regularly with alternative history &ndash; which is itself also known as &quot;virtual history&quot; and &quot;alternative outcome analysis &ndash; the conservation of historical reality. That is, to make the assumptions and results of our simulation as valid as possible, we made the fewest possible changes needed to the historic timeline in order to put our alternative one in place.

The board represents the machine which distributes newly-minted marbles from the center and funnels them to one of six goal areas at the edge of the board.  The winning player is the one who can manipulate the process to get the most marbles by the end of the day.&quot;<br/><br/>Players manipulate the process by playing Machine Tiles: Machine Parts &amp; Modifiers, or Marbles during their turns. Machine Parts alter the direction or behavior of Marble Tiles that move over them on a turn. Some Machine Part Tiles reverse direction, redirect, push or jump the Marble.<br/>Modifier Tiles allow players to reposition or remove previously played Machine Part Tiles.<br/><br/>Marble Tiles are printed with a directional arrow and a value from 1 to 4. The player positions the arrow in a direction of his choosing in the center of the board. When subsequent marbles are placed, all marbles currently on the board will move in the direction of their arrow the distance identified by their printed value.<br/><br/>Players must play at least one, and at most two, tiles per turn. If a player plays a marble on her first turn, she immediately takes a second turn, playing another marble or a Machine Tile (A machine Part of Modifier).<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no tiles left for a player to draw or a player has met the specified marble quota for the game. This triggers the final phase, in which the machine keeps running until all of the marbles on the board reach their final destination. After the final phase, the player with the most marbles wins the game.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

The games are touted as being good for the brain.<br/><br/>There are at least four different games you can play with the Janken Plus set, though not all of them are Rock-Scissors-Paper games.<br/><br/>1. Janken Game: Because the four boards are interlocking, they can be arranged differently, as a 6X6 square (basic game using all 24 janken pieces), or other arrangements with games for 12 pieces.<br/><br/>The pieces can be moved in any direction, any number of squares. Pieces are taken in the traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock way. The game ends when one player has only two pieces left. On the box it says it's a similar game to Shogi.<br/><br/>2. Play-off Janken: Each player places their pieces face down; they can arrange the pieces as they like. The board isn&rsquo;t used. They each choose one piece and play janken. The winner is the player who captures the most of their opponent&rsquo;s pieces. (This is not a thinking game.)<br/><br/>3. Tic-Tac-Toe variant: Using one board, the players play a Tic-Tac-Toe game aiming to get three pieces in a row. Once a player has played three pieces, he or she can only move them on the board. A variant is to use two or more unconnected boards and more pieces, with the ability to move pieces from board to board.<br/><br/>4. Pinch-pon: Players use six pieces each on the 6X6 board. They capture their opponent&rsquo;s pieces by sandwiching them between two of their own (as in the ancient game of Hnefatafl and similar games).<br/><br/>",2004,,,

To play, the dragons are removed from the deck and shuffled.  Every player gets one dragon.  The remaining 72 cards are shuffled and six are dealt to each player.<br/><br/>Three of the suits are attacking suits, three are defending suits, and two suits may be used for either.  On your turn, you attack a dragon of your choice (but not your own!) by playing attack cards.  The owner responds by playing defense cards.  The attacker may continue the attack if he has more of the same suit he started with.  If he does, the defender may defend with any defensive suit.  Once the attacker calls a halt, subtract defense cards from attack cards.  If the number is positive, the dragon takes that many hits.  (Each dragon has a number of hit points equal to the number on the card.)  Dead dragons are placed in the attacking player's victory point pile, and the defender draws a new dragon to defend, if there are any left.<br/><br/>Rules are provided for &quot;despoilers&quot; - players whose last dragon is removed after the dragon deck has run out.  (In a ten-player game, that's always!)  The game ends one round after there is only one dragon left in play: everyone else has one turn to try to defeat it.

Players accomplish this by obtaining proper position with their planes and diving on or shooting down opponents and bombing anti-aircraft guns.&quot;<br/><br/>The game board is a vertical piece of cardboard in which the wings of miniature aircraft are inserted to give a feel of the current layout of aircraft.<br/><br/>(Note that this is different from the 1963 game of the same name.)<br/><br/>",1940,,,

Three traveler cards are dealt to the centre of the table, one of which is face up - this is the value of the holiday. The other players, in turn, may agree to this destination, or change it by paying one traveler card (and augmenting the value of the holiday). This goes round, players changing destinations as long as they want to and can afford to, until everyone finally agrees on the destination.<br/><br/>Players then play cards that match the criteria for that destination and the player who plays travelers with the highest score wins the holiday. This is scored as the value from the initial 3 cards plus any extra cards played to change the destination, divided by ten. Points that don't make up to ten exactly don't contribute to the score.<br/><br/>The player to first score 10 points wins.<br/><br/>The game has a nice element of bluffing as a player could propose holiday destinations they have no interest in so that after other players change the destination, they can change it to the real place they'd prefer to go.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

It places the player in the position of the head of some neutral or belligerent country and lets him use his own judgment as to how present international problems should be met and overcome.<br/><br/>&quot;TACTICS may be played by two belligerents, or by two belligerents and one or both neutrals.<br/><br/>&quot;The object for belligerents is to blockade opponent belligerent's SEAPORT and for neutrals to trade for profit.  Blockade is accomplished when a belligerent's SEAPORT is completely cut off from the sea.  Trade is accomplished when a SUPPLY SHIP is moved into another player's port.&quot;<br/><br/>Neutrals accumulate victory points through trade, but may be attacked by belligerents, which allows them to play a diplomatic protest card. If a third protest card is accepted (they can be dodged by paying a gold), then that neutral joins the war against the offending nation. Neutrals may try to provoke attacks in order to pile on and share the war loot with the victorious belligerent.<br/><br/>War is a game of manoeuver: battleships kill transports easily, but killing a battleship requires getting two friendly battleships on opposite sides of the target. Each nation has two planes, but these only come into play through chance cards, as do submarines (each of which lurks in a particular square of the board and kills an enemy ship that moves onto the square).<br/><br/>",1940,,,

19053,Mortality,['Roll / Spin and Move'],['Religious'],"From the publisher:<br/><br/>Mortality is an uplifting LDS board game about life rather than strictly a &quot;church&quot; game. It isn't made to teach a list of &quot;facts&quot; about the gospel. Instead, gospel principles are woven into the very fabric of the game. It doesn't give any advantage to the scriptorians or historians. Succeeding at the game requires cooperation, caring for other players, knowing how to build a solid foundation in one's youth, and an understanding of how faith and testimony help you endure trials, and any player who approaches the game in this manner can win.<br/><br/>The game is great at fostering friendly interaction among the players. Even the losers enjoy it, because they tend to end up being the focus of charitable efforts by the other players. Succeeding at the game requires strategy, luck, and advance planning. It teaches LDS values, including the importance of building a foundation that will withstand the adversities of life, the value that hardships can have in building testimony, and the benefits of selfless service. Yes, there is competition in Mortality, because there is a winner, and that's a big part of the entertainment value. But a great part of the fun is in the joking that surrounds the dealing together with experiences and trials in the game that are so much a part of life, but are presented in a somewhat humorous way.<br/><br/>Mortality takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half to play, depending on the experience and luck of the players. It requires a minimum of three players and up to six can play. Young children can be helped to play the game, but truly understanding it requires an age of at least eight.<br/><br/>You start the game in the childhood section. Here you gain points or &quot;Testimonies&quot; as they are called, strictly by chance, based on what your family does. From there you enter the youth section. As a youth, you begin making decisions on your own that can help you later on or be a detriment to your later progress. You can serve as an LDS missionary, go on dates, and either get a civil marriage or a temple marriage. Avoiding a civil marriage may require some careful advance planning in order to avoid landing on the &quot;civil marriage&quot; square. From there you move into the adult section. One player gets to be the bishop. This assignment may pass from player to player depending on what happens in the game. As you move around in the adult section, you encounter trials of faith. Depending on how many Testimonies you already have, these trials can hurt you or help you. You also have an opportunity to help other players, for which you will gain even more Testimonies. The first player with 150 Testimonies &quot;finishes mortality&quot; and is the winner.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

19118,"Grey Storm, Red Steel",['Simulation'],"['Miniatures', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","Grey Storm, Red Steel is a set of miniatures rules for small-unit tactical combat on the Eastern Front in World War 2. The scale of the game is a 1:1 representation of men and equipment. Time scale is one game turn equals 2 and a half minutes; ground scale is 1 inch equals 10 meters. The miniatures are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle teams (3-4 figures), light machine gun teams (2 figures), leaders (1 figure) and weapons teams (2-4 figures depending on the weapon). Tanks and vehicles are mounted singly. Infantry units are made up of two or more rifle teams and zero to two light machine gun teams.<br/><br/>The rules work very well for representing actions on a platoon or company scale. The rules are best for infantry actions. The rules for tanks are not very detailed: one die roll to see if a hit is made, another for the result based on a comparison of the penetrative ability of gun firing with the overall armor quality of the target. However, they tend to give as good an end result as more complex rules. Anti-tank weapons range from the PzB38/39 and PTRD AT rifles to massive 128mm and 152mm AT guns.<br/><br/>GSRS provides rules for hidden set up, pre-battle recon, weather, command control, and target location that can be used to make challenging game scenarios. There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules for things like Panzer Aces, Heroes of the Soviet Union, and civilians in the combat zone. The rules also cover the use of cavalry and air support.<br/><br/>The rules includes a lot of information about unit organization, AFV data, and aircraft data. There is also a section detailing the differences between Soviet and German tactics and capabilities.<br/><br/>GSRS is a somewhat obscure and underrated set of miniatures rules that provides a great deal of flavor and compares very well to tactical boardgames like Squad Leader, ASL, and the Advanced Tobruk (ATS) series.<br/><br/>",1995,,,

For even more excitement, you can mix up your deck with another friend's deck and see what happens.

As well as this base set additional units &amp; even vehicles were also available in non-random booster packs.<br/><br/>The Havok Miniatures Game was intended to fill a gap in the market by posing as a cheap alternative to Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition).

It's the kind of game for those nights when you'd like to play something, but don't want to commit to a traditional fantasy sports simulation.<br/><br/>One of the great mysteries of the sport of Elfball is just where it began, and how it got its name. The Elves of the vast forests of the Westerlands claim to have been playing the sport since the dawn of time, and that they named it in honor of themselves. The Dwarves and Orcs, high in their mountain homes, dispute this bold claim and insist that the game&rsquo;s name instead refers to the type of severed head that makes the best ball core; both races maintain that they are in fact the originators and some of the bloodiest wars in the history of the realms have been fought over this claim. The men of the Middle Kingdoms ignore the squabbles of the elder races and call the game De Circque instead.<br/><br/>Today Elfball is played by every nation and tribe of the world, and with a few regional variations, it is played the same on fields throughout The Realms. The design of the field, the distinctive ball, and the rules of play are all quite standardized.<br/><br/>This game was prototyped in 2002 by Phigs Miniatures but did not see production until the game rules were overhauled and changed about 80% from the prototype and then released by Impact!

The player purposefully conducts the affairs of the Russian Empire and its allies, while the game system does the same for the anti-Russian coalition made up of a shifting alliance of powers.<br/><br/>Central to play of the game are its 'policy cards.' They trigger various strategies, powers at war, and other events that shape the general course of play. Policy cards are activated in one of two ways: the Empire player can choose which policies he will activate, while coalition policies are activated by the draw of markers. The Empire player may move his forces freely. The game system moves coalition forces according to a schedule of precedence.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for the Russian Empire to have gained an advantageous position at the end of play, measured in terms of gaining certain objectives. The player must, however, also look toward maintaining the &quot;balance of power,&quot; or he may face disintegration of the entire European state system. Depending on how well the player attains his objectives, then, will really be the thing that determines the nature of victory.<br/><br/>While Catherine the Great has been purpose-designed to be a solitaire game, more than one can play at the same time as part of a Russian Empire command team. Players can divvy up responsibilities as they please for different parts of the Russian Empire, with the most veteran gamer taking the role of Czar and deciding who gets what resources.

A hand is won by taking the majority of tricks or by making the opponent(s) fold to a raise. Only ranks of cards are important in Le Truc, not suits. If two cards of the same rank are played in a trick it is &quot;spoiled&quot; and not counted for either side. The first trick of a hand is particularly important, because it acts as a tiebreaker when both sides win an equal number of tricks.<br/><br/>There is a Brazilian variant know as Truco that also includes a card value to have higher in-game value than others.

Different ghosts belong to different players, which is why each player needs their own color of chips.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>--Draw your hand up to 5 cards.<br/>--Play a card and 'haunt' the room containing the card you played. To haunt a room, place a chip of your color on the top of the stack of chips in that room (unless a chip of your color is on the top of the stack), or begin a stack if none exists. You also haunt adjacent rooms that are already haunted (have chips of any color in the room).<br/>--Move one guest according to the roll of 2 D6<br/><br/>When a guest lands in a haunted room, points are awarded to the ghosts in that room.

19271,Glutter of Ravens: Warfare in the Age of Arthur – Rules and Resources for Wargames in the Period AD400-AD700,['Simulation'],"['Medieval', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","&quot;Rules and resources for wargames in the period AD400-AD700.&quot;<br/><br/>The name comes from a line in the Welsh epic Y Gododdin, &quot;He glutted black ravens on the walls of the fort, but he was no Arthur.&quot;<br/><br/>Daniel Mersey, the designer, is a British archaeologist who wanted a set of miniature wargame rules that specifically captured the style of warfare in Dark Ages Britain in the period between the Roman departure and the coming of the Vikings; the age that was dominated by the legendary war-leader Arthur.<br/><br/>The armies represented in the rules are mostly the British kingdoms that arose after the Romans left Britannia. However, there are also the external enemies of these kingdoms: the Irish, the Picts, and the Saxons. There is also an army list for Romans.<br/><br/>Figures are mounted in multiples on stands that represent warbands. Warband types can be Heavy Cavalry (HC), Light Cavalry (LC), Heavy Infantry (HI), and Light Infantry (LI). The warbands are further distinguished by a set of three &quot;characteristics&quot; that play an important role in movement and combat. These characteristics are Formation, Aggression, and Strength and are represented by a numerical value that can fluctuate during the game. Based on warband type and nationality or kingdom, there are set maximums for each of these characteristics. If the value for any one characteristic decreases to zero, the warband is lost.<br/><br/>Players control their armies through Command Points that are determined by a die roll. Using his Command Points, a player can move his warbands or increase their Formation and Aggression values up to the maximum allowed. (The Strength characteristic represents the number of warriors in the warband. Once a Strength point is lost, it stays lost.)<br/><br/>Armies are divided into two distinct categories of warband. The Comitatus represents the personal retinue of the leader, the trained warriors whose only job is to be fighters. The Contingent represents levy troops who are not primarily warriors but can be pressed into service to swell the numbers of an army. The maximum Formation and Aggression values for the Comitatus are higher than those for the Contingent.<br/><br/>When choosing the warbands that make up his army, a player must use all the Comitatus warbands in his army list (there are always five). However, he may choose any number of the Contingent warbands from none to all. The number of warbands in the army is a critical pre-game decision a player must make. The starting values for Formation and Aggression are assigned to the warbands from a pool of 30 Command Points that a player starts with. Even if he chooses only the Comitatus, he will likely be unable to start with his warbands at maximum values and must build them up during the game using his Command Points. This &quot;building up&quot; of the warbands represents the need for a leader to organize and inspire his warriors for them to be at their maximum effectiveness in battle. If a player divides his 30 Command Points between too many warbands, the starting values will be very low and he must spend several turns building up his warbands.<br/><br/>Combat is divided between missile file and melee. Every warband has some kind of missile weapon (javelins, slings, bows). Firing is done by comparing a firing warband's Strength to the target's modified die roll. If the die roll is lower than the firing unit's Strength, some effect is made against the target.<br/><br/>The values that warbands use for melee depends on the nature of contact: warbands that move into combat use their Aggression value, warbands who are stationary when contacted use their Formation value, and warbands that are continuing a melee (no initial contact this turn) use their Strength--the combat has degenerated to a slog bewteen mobs of armed men.<br/><br/>As a result of combat, warbands may Stand, Rally Back, or Retreat in addition to varying losses in Formation, Aggression, and Strength. A very successful warband may actually increase Aggression as a result of combat. Warbands are never eliminated outright in combat unless their losses reduce one of their characteristics to zero. In many cases, a warband has to get hammered for several rounds of melee before it is lost.<br/><br/>Glutter of Ravens is based on the Dark Age Infantry Slog concept that was featured in a volume of Wargames Illustrated magazine. The rules also seem to borrow from the De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) rules from WRG. However, the nuances in the rules create enough distinction that you get the feel you are not simply playing a version of DBA.<br/><br/>The rules also contain a great deal of background information about the period that include notes about the armies of the era, color plates of warriors of the period, a very good bibliography, and a presentation of the debate, &quot;Arthur: Fact or Fiction?&quot;<br/><br/>",1998,,,

Make fantastic medical claims for your bottled elixir. Slander your opponents and steal their secrets! Avoid angry mobs and law enforcement while weaseling the highest price possible for your Snake-Oil!<br/><br/>3-4 players is ideal, but can be played by 2-8.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>The Setting: In the latter part of the 19th Century and well into the 20th, an industry boomed across the American Midwest. That industry was the Medicine Show, where any entrepreneur with a questionable recipe and plenty of business savvy could pull his wagon up to the center of town and hawk his medicinal wares for a few cents per bottle. You and your opponents are these peddlers of &ldquo;Snake-Oil&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Object: In Snake-Oil, the object is to achieve the highest per bottle price for your elixir. To do this, you may have to hire thugs, slander your opponents and plant ringers in the crowd. But it&rsquo;s all in good fun and, hey, you always have the next town for your opponents to get revenge.<br/><br/>Game Length: A game of Snake-Oil can last is little as 5 minutes or as long as an hour, depending on how many towns you and your opponents decide to hit. Each hand of Snake-Oil constitutes a town. The game includes a score sheet with room for the name of your product and a running tally for three towns. When you&rsquo;ve played the number of hands you&rsquo;ve agreed upon, add up the totals for each town and the winner is the player with the highest total value.<br/><br/>Setup: Each player is dealt 7 cards face down (if there are more than 4 players, deal 5 cards each). This constitutes his hand at the start of the game. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table, and the discard pile will go next to it. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left goes first.<br/><br/>Play: A player must first play a Cure if he has one. This goes directly in front of him in his playing area. He may then play any other card (except for another Cure). If he doesn&rsquo;t have a Cure to play first, he may go directly to playing his second card. [Cards that are not Cures modify the value of the Cures or may cause Cures to be switched or discarded, etc.] He may opt not to play a second card. At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, he may draw as many cards from the deck as necessary to ensure he ends the turn with 7 cards in his hand. A player may opt to discard his entire hand and draw an equal amount of cards from the deck in lieu of playing any cards on his turn. This simply indicates his wagon has burned down and he&rsquo;s buying new ingredients.<br/><br/>Ending the Hand: The hand ends when the player who draws the last card from the deck finishes his turn, or when a hand-ending card is played successfully. There are 2 such cards: Rain! and Bust!. There is also a counter (or negating card) for each of them. A player may not end the hand by this method unless he has a value of at least 20&cent; in front of him. Ending a hand by this method does not affect any cards already in play.<br/><br/>Added Hype: There is a quick table included to randomly determine the name of your product (handy if you&rsquo;re playing a four town Medicine Show). Snake-Oil is fun to play, but it&rsquo;s a lot MORE fun when players start getting into the spirit of the game and hyping their products with zeal.

Factors such as the hieght of the firing ship's gun platform from sea level and a target factor based on the target ship's size are cross-referenced with the range to determine the &quot;Danger Space&quot; that extends beyond the ship model. All shots that are estimated to fall within the Danger Space are considered hits. The location of hits is determined from the Hit Probability Table and Armor chart that is unique to every ship. After this, penetration, damage, and critical hits are determined. The whole process for a single shot can be lengthy. Games that involve several model ships can take a very long time to adjudicate all the shots in any one game turn.<br/><br/>The rules recommend that judges be used in the game in order to adjudicate the shots and record damage that only the player commanding the ship can see. Because of the time involved in this, the rules also recommend that an area be set aside for the players commanding the ships to play other games (like Monopoly) while waiting for the results of the firing to be determined.<br/><br/>The area needed for play can be quite large. Gun ranges at 1:2400 scale can go up to 30 feet. Something like a gymnasium floor is the best place to play if you plan on a large fleet action like Dogger Bank or Jutland.<br/><br/>For small actions, like the SMS Emden vs. the HMAS Sydney, these rules can be very good becasue the detail makes the individual action more exciting. However, the rules don't work for actions that are larger than Coronel or The Falklands.<br/><br/>Despite its claim to cover the period from 1890 to 1920, Cordite and Steel is solely dedicated to naval combat in World War One. The only ship cards and Danger Space Tables supplied are for German and British WWI ships and guns. It would be very difficult to expand the game to other eras because of the intense amount of research needed to create ship cards and gun tables for other navies and wars.<br/><br/>",1977,,,

19291,Redcoat,"['Area Movement', 'Simulation']","['Age of Reason', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","&quot;The Bicentennial Wargame&quot;<br/><br/>Redcoat was unique for its time in that it was designed to be a campaign game where the battles are fought out using miniatures. The game includes three booklets: Campaign Game, Miniatures Game, and Historical Analysis.<br/><br/>The Campaign Game is played on a map of the American colonies that is divided into regions. Each region is worth a number of victory points for the British player if they hold it. Holding a region requires a garrison whose size varies by region. For example, Massachussetts Bay requires a garrison of 4000 men; the Mohawk Valley requires a garrison of only 500 men. Regions also provide a number of Loyalists that can be recruited as Provincial units in the British army, Militia who fight as partisans against the British, and a variable number of Continental Army recruits.<br/><br/>Movement in the campaign is by area (Region). Americans move pretty freely, but the British forces can have some difficulty getting around. This represents the fact that the British found it hard to get their armies where they wanted them when they wanted them (for example, Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne's miserable time in upper New York in 1777). As the British move through areas, they trigger the arrival of loyalists and militia.<br/><br/>Campaign years are divided into four seasons (turns). The fourth season is winter, which prohibits any British units from moving while allowing American forces to move at a lower rate. However, winter also causes &quot;winter attrition&quot; among American Continental units.<br/><br/>American forces are created through Continental recruitment and militia (who appear as a result of British being in an area). British forces, except for Provincial units, arrive (and leave) according to their historical schedules. The French may intervene depending on whether the Americans can win a Major Victory.<br/><br/>Winning the campaign game for the British requires a long, slow haul of hanging on to sufficient regions (which generate victory points) from 1775 to 1783. Americans win the campaign game by winning Major Victories over the British or by holding out and denying the British their victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules for the Miniatures Game are pretty standard for 1976, but compare very well to many current rules. The ground scale is 1&quot; equals 15 yards. Time scale is 1 turn equals 15 minutes. Figure scale is variable; regulars are 1:30 while milita and Indians are 1:50.<br/><br/>The size of the playing area depends on the number of combatants in the campaign battle. The terrain set up for a battle depends on the size of the playing area and the Terrain Factor of the region where the battle is located. The defending player places the terrain in the playing area and the attacking player chooses which edge of the playing area he will deploy on.<br/><br/>Morale plays a large part in the game. British units tend to be very good, while American units are mostly average to poor. Battles can be a challenge for the Americans, but they can rely on their strengths in skirmishing and shooting--and avoiding British bayonet charges.<br/><br/>Leaders play a significant role in the game and are specified as Class I and Class II, who are named individuals, and Class III, who represent generic leaders. The rules offer ratings for different historical generals (Benedict Arnold is only rated once as an American).<br/><br/>Without being difficult, the rules add some nuances that bring out the flavor of 18th century warfare. Shooting is *very deadly* at point blank range (1&quot;), but its effect attenuates dramatically as the range increases. Units that stand to receive a charge roll on a Volley Effectiveness Table to determine the range when they open fire. Poorer units will fire too soon and waste the potential destructiveness of the volley; better units can hold their fire on the attacker until they &quot;see the whites of their eyes.&quot;<br/><br/>There are also some &quot;chrome&quot; rules like sappers, Indians, Night Attacks, and the &quot;Simcoe/Tarelton Bugle Tactic.&quot;<br/><br/>",1976,,,

Miller).<br/><br/>&quot;Verdun: A Dagger at the Heart of France&quot; is an Operational level board-wargame simulation of the 1916 German offensive that was supposed to &quot;bleed the French white&quot; in a single great battle of attrition, but instead turned into a bloody debacle of 10 months of slaughter.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are mostly conventional for hex and counter wargames. Movement, stacking, and Zones of Control are typical of most other games. Combat consists of artillery barrage and infantry assault.<br/><br/>Artillery can play a big part in the game, as it did historically in the battle. Players are limited in using their artillery by the ammunition factors they must keep track of on the Ammunition Availability Chart. Artillery expends ammunition factors when it fires, which may cause shortages. So, despite a large number of artillery units on both sides, players must use their guns judiciously.<br/><br/>Assault is done after movement and after artillery bombardment. Attackers must designate their assaults during the movement phase before artillery fire. As a result of artillery fire, both an attacker and defender can be severely affected. Attackers must carry out their assaults regardless of losses from artillery, which can be disastrous.<br/><br/>Supply rules are typical of many wargames. The rules provide means of destroying the opposing players artillery ammunition stocks and for interdicting rail lines and roads that serve as supply lines.<br/><br/>The game adds some chrome with German pioneers (who aid in assaults), balloons spotting for artillery, road interdiction (which affects French supply), and gas attacks. There are also rules for the Germans reducing the fortresses that surround Verdun.<br/><br/>While control of the city of Verdun is a primary victory condition for the game, the real key to victory is the amount of attrition each side does to the other.<br/><br/>",1978,,,

Howe moves his forces onto Long Island and uses a long flanking march to get behind the advance American forces, but does not follow up his victory with an assault on the American main line. Fearing a naval trap, Washington retreats his forces to Manhattan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Harlem Heights (16 Sep 1776). After positioning new lines at the neck of Manhattan, the British move onto Manhattan and take New York City. On 16 September, an American foraging party runs into a British scouting force and a skirmish begins. Both sides begin sending forces into the developing battle. The Americans push the British back two miles nearly reaching the British camps before being stopped. The American morale, flagging after the defeat and retreat from Brooklyn, was restored. Still, the growing British threat to outflank the Americans forced Washington to fall back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     White Plains (28 Oct 1776) Historically, the battle ended after a lengthy skirmish on Chatterton Hill between a mixed force of British and Hessians versus American militia and regulars. The slow moving British prepared for a battle three days later, but by then Washington had retreated further north to cross the Hudson River and head south to New Jersey. Howe decided not to pursue and instead seized Ft. Washington. However, there are accounts that suggest that Howe might have assaulted the main American line immediately.<br/><br/><br/>The New Jersey Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Trenton (26 Dec 1776) Washington conceives of a bold move to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian outpost in Trenton as a means to gain a victory, and turn the morale of his troops. After crossing the Delaware and marching for several hours in snow and sleet, the force divided into two columns in an effort to surround Trenton, and cut off retreat and reinforcement. The Hessians had no expectation of a surprise attack, and partied late into Christmas night. The American columns managed to emerge almost simultaneously on the few pickets, overwhelming them, and moving in and around Trenton as the Hessians scrambled to defend themselves. In less than two hours, almost the entire 1,400 man garrison was bagged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Princeton (3 Jan 1777) At the end of 1776, Washington was facing the imminent departure of most of his remaining force. He makes a plea for men to stay on for six more weeks for an additional bounty and was able to pull together 5,000 troops. With these, he crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey again. Sidestepping the British forces marching to Trenton along the main road, the Americans make a back road march towards Princeton. Sending a force to guard a bridge over the main road to slow a British response, this force runs into a trailing British regiment. A battle ensues in a nearby field.

19308,War Games Rules Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Century (1490-1660),"['Dice Rolling', 'Measurement Movement', 'Simulation']","['Miniatures', 'Pike and Shot', 'Renaissance', 'Wargame']","War Games Rules Sixteenth and early Seventeenth Century (1490-1660) are designed for recreating the battles of the Renaissance with 25mm miniatures. They use a figure scale of 1 figure equals 20 men and a ground scale of 1&quot; equals 20 paces.<br/><br/>Units are made up of five or more figures. Units are rated by such things as how they are armed, what kind or armor protection they have, how they are trained, and what level of morale they have.<br/><br/>Shooting and hand to hand combat are done by comparing the weapon of the attacker with the armor of the defender, and then adding tactical factors to get a total factor, which is then cross-referenced with the number of figures in the unit that is shooting or attacking. The result is an actual number of casualties in men, which players have to divide by 20 to see how many figures are removed from the unit. Casualties that are less than 20 are noted and added to further casualties later on. This way of recording casualties, which was unique to the WRG games of the 70s, is a nice way of getting around an all-or-nothing casualty removal system. Even if casualties are few in any single combat event, there is still a cumulative effect that can cause figure removal later on.<br/><br/>The morale of units may need to be checked with a Reaction Test for several reasons throughout the game. There are many variables that can affect the Reaction Test. Each variable adds to or subtracts from a roll of three average dice (2-3-3-4-4-5). The result is cross-referenced with the morale grade of the unit to determine the outcome. As a result of a Reaction Test, a unit may initiate an uncontrolled advance towards the nearest enemy, break and run away, or do something in between (the best result is always &quot;carry on&quot;).<br/><br/>Units are given orders at the start of a game. Units must move and attack according to their orders until they lose their orders through a failed Reaction Test or until the orders are changed. Orders are the only command/control mechanism in the game. Players always have one CinC figure and may have one or more sub-generals. The CinC and sub-generals mostly aid in combat and Reaction Tests.<br/><br/>The rules are complex and require players to use good tactical sense, which includes supporting units with other units (this helps in Reaction Tests) and knowing when and where to attack an opponent's units to get the best possible result. They are much more subtle than the Warhammer games produced by Games Workshop. They aren't designed for a quick &quot;bash 'em up.&quot; They take time to learn, but they reward players who use sound tactics rather than players who are lucky with dice.<br/><br/>The first edition of the rules covers warfare from about the beginning of the Italian Wars to the end of the English Civil Wars. The second edition adds things like handguns (primitive firearms) and plug bayonets that allow for wargaming battles from the latter part of the Hundred Years War, which saw the introduction of firearms, to the Nine Years War in the Low Countries, which was the end of the Pike and Shot era. The second edition also adds siege rules.<br/><br/>Note: The second edition rules are called Wargames Rules for Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries (1420-1700).<br/><br/>These wargame rules are based on an earlier set of rules by Dave Millward called Musketeer. They are also heavily based on Wargames Research Group's (WRG) 4th and 5th edition Ancients rules, which pioneered the basic game mechanics.<br/><br/>As with other WRG rules, several Army Lists were separately published that provide guidelines for players to create historical armies.<br/><br/>",1976,,,

19330,Overlord: Wargame Rules for the Normandy Campaign – June-August 1944,['Simulation'],"['Miniatures', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","Overlord is a set of miniature wargame rules that cover tactical-level combat in Normandy from June to August, 1944. The rules are suitable for 1:300th to 28mm scale, though they work best for 15mm miniatures.<br/><br/>The ground scale for the game is 1&quot; equals 10 metres, 1 turn equals 2 1/2 minutes, 1 model soldier/vehicle equals 1 real soldier/vehicle.<br/><br/>The basic unit for the game is an infantry squad or individual gun and crew or single AFV. Infantry are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle groups, light machine gun groups, heavy machine gun groups, light mortar groups. etc. Leaders, who represent platoon leaders and senior NCOs, are mounted singly.<br/><br/>The sequence of play follows traditional lines: Initiative, Move, Fire, Close Assault, Morale. However, there is a Watch and Shoot phase, where units can elect to fire before the normal Fire phase or hold their fire to take opportunity fire against the opponent's moving units. Only units with Watch and Shoot orders can take opportunity fire.<br/><br/>Firing is done by individual stands; there is no mechanism for combining the fire of several stands, though the results of fire combat can have a cumulative effect. Fire combat uses a unique system where a firing stand's weapon type is first cross-referenced with one of six major columns that represent the cover state of the target unit(s), then cross-referenced with the result of a modified die roll. Results can create individual casualties for a stand or, in a separate die roll, the loss of the entire stand. Because casualties represent the loss of single soldiers, a stand may take several casualties before it is lost.<br/><br/>Before units can be targeted for fire, they must be spotted. The visibility of units can be affected by  activities such as moving, firing, etc. Units might be very difficult to spot, which represents the historical difficulty of seeing the enemy in the dense terrain of Normandy. In larger games, keeping track of which units are spotted may be cumbersome.<br/><br/>Morale is strictly based on the performance of historical units. There is a special category called Fanatic that is used solely by units of the 12th SS &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; division. This represents the relative inexperience of the troops combined with the fanaticism instilled in them through their Hitler Youth indoctrination. Most Allied units are classed as Inexperienced, which represents the fact that, though well-trained, they are experiencing combat for the first time. Other Classifications are Elite (such as Airborne units and most of the SS), Veteran (most German units), and Poor (such as German Ostbattalion units).<br/><br/>The antitank rules are fairly simply, but they tend to provide predictable historical results. The rules don't really seem to emphasize tank combat. Rather, tanks are added in as a specialized heavy weapon, but the rules are not intended for large tank vs. tank actions.<br/><br/>The game play allows for hidden set up and limited hidden movement, which can give the defender (usually the Germans) the ability to mount a very tenacious defense while being strongly outnumbered.<br/><br/>Overlord can be used to play games that consist of only a few squads or up to a full battalion on each side. However, larger games can be slow.<br/><br/>Many of the mechanics for Overlord are similar to the mechanics used in the designer's other WW2 tactical rules, &quot;Grey Storm, Red Steel.&quot;<br/><br/>",1994,,,

Some of the sea tiles of the base game are transformed into Fishing Grounds. These Fishing Grounds produce resources in a way similar to regular tiles.<br/><br/>Instead of Resource Cards, Fishing Grounds provide Fish Tiles. Fish Tiles can be worth one, two or three fish.<br/><br/>During his turn, a player can spend fish to get a special benefit:<br/>2 fish: The player may move the robber back into the desert (he/she may not steal a card from another player who owns a settlement / town at the desert).<br/>3 fish: The player may steal a raw material card from another player.<br/>4 fish: The player may take any one raw material from the bank.<br/>5 fish: The player may build a street immediately.<br/>7 fish: The player receives a development card for free.<br/><br/>In addition to fish, a player can also catch an old shoe. As long as a player has the old shoe in his possession, he needs one more point to win the game than usual. He can get rid of the old shoe by giving it to someone with the same number of points or more points than himself.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    CATAN<br/><br/><br/>",2005,,,

19350,Naval Wargames Rules Fleet Action 1000 B.C. to 500 A.D.,['Simulation'],"['Ancient', 'Miniatures', 'Nautical', 'Wargame']","Naval Wargames Rules Fleet Action 1000 B.C. to 500 A.D. are ancient naval wargaming rules that are simplified enough to allow for large fleet actions using model ships.<br/><br/>The ships range from small open galleys to large Hellenistic-era &quot;16s&quot; (sixteen men per oar--the dreadnoughts of their time). Ship models are organized in squadrons of varying size. Each ship is rated by speed, ramming factor, and boarding factor. Ship's speed is also affected by crew quality.<br/><br/>The game is played on an area marked off by hexagons or offset rectangles. Terrain can be added in the form of coastline or rocks (or perhaps a Scylla and Charybdis).<br/><br/>Movement can be by oar, sail, or boat-sail. Each type of propulsion has its own pluses and minuses. Moving by oars can tire your crews, but moving by sail makes you subject to the wind--also, having a sail aboard your boats can be a negative for taking reaction tests (have sail, will sail away).<br/><br/>The action is pretty fast when ships start crunching together. The rules for ramming are simple and deadly. Boarding actions can be affected by the use of towers or &quot;ferrea manus&quot; (grappling devices such as the Roman corvus). Some ships may have war engines that can kill crew and reduce an opponent's boarding factor.<br/><br/>Once a squadron starts losing ships, it may be forced to retire by a negative Reaction Test result.<br/><br/>There isn't much &quot;chrome&quot; in these rules. Players wanting more detail on ship handling and employing ancient naval tactics (like the deikplous), should use a different set of rules. However, for gaming an action that involves a large number of ships, these rules allow fast play and a game resolution in a reasonable amount of time.<br/><br/>",1973,,,

19354,The Devil at the Helm Naval Warfare 1850-1906,['Simulation'],"['American Civil War', 'Book', 'Civil War', 'Miniatures', 'Nautical', 'Wargame']","The Devil at the Helm is a set of miniatures rules for naval warfare in the ironclad and pre-dreadnought eras.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;The years between 1850 and 1906 saw immense changes in naval warfare.<br/><br/>&quot;From lines of stately three-deckers, the great powers' fleets changed to a multitude of armoured warships, each unit of which represented a pinnacle of design and engineering skill. Forces became a hotch-potch of individual ships, differing widely in their abilities and deficiencies, as the older ships mixed with the new. Specialized missions and hostile environments sometimes necessitated vessels of novel and awkward design, such as the river craft of the American Civil War. With these new ships came new and terrifying weapons, destroying forever the world of Nelson and Hornblower.<br/><br/>&quot;However, two factors bound this era of change into a single period: the predominance of steam propulsion and the control of gunnery by individual gunners.<br/><br/>&quot;It is upon these two factors that this set of rules has been based, enabling players to experience the changes &quot;first hand&quot; as a continuous process rather than examining each conflict in the period as an event unrelated to any other, and to appreciate as a whole the era of naval warfare before the Dreadnought.&quot;<br/><br/>These rules offer some interesting mechanics to take into account the vast changes in naval warfare that occurred during the period they cover. Rules exist for maneuvering ships under sail, under steam power, and under a combination of both sail and steam.<br/><br/>Gunnery includes muzzle-loading smooth bore cannon, muzzle-loading rifled cannon, early breech-loading cannon, and modern naval ordnance. The gunnery also includes rules to cover the different effects of the rounds that could be fired, such as solid round shot, solid armor-piercing (AP) shot, later AP shell, and common shell.<br/><br/>Ships' armor values are calculated using tables in the rules that cover such things as the kind of metal (solid iron, laminated iron, mild steel, Harveyized steel, Krupp steel, etc.) and, for earlier ironclads, the type and thickness of the wood backing the iron armor.<br/><br/>For an aficionado of the era, the rules can be very interesting because of the details of ship design and armament that are addressed.<br/><br/>However, there is something about the wide scope of the rules that creates problems. For example, to determine where a shot hits, players roll on a table that lists the various parts of a ship. But the parts listed don't apply to all ships within the period. Things like &quot;secondary turrets&quot; don't exist on an ironclad ram. Inapplicable hits are simply assigned to one of two areas, but this tends to skew the hit allocation.<br/><br/>There are very few ready-to-go ship stats included in the rules. Players are expected to create ships stats to use in the game based on the guidelines in the rules for designing these using data from external sources, such as &quot;Jane's Fighting Ships,&quot; &quot;Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships,&quot; and others.<br/><br/>Players will also need to supply the templates used to determine the turning radii of the model ships. The ones included in the rules are hand drawn and not really suitable for play.<br/><br/>One the whole, The Devil at the Helm has a lot of good ideas and is a strong basis for a good set of naval wargame rules for this period. But they leave a lot of rough edges for the players to smooth.<br/><br/>",1978,,,
19355,Fusil & Fortress,['Simulation'],"['Age of Reason', 'Book', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","&quot;Being an Account of the Art of War During the Time of His Grace The Duke of Marlborough&quot;<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Fusil and Fortress is a Systems Analysis Classic Series game which offers the player an incredible amount of detail while providing a game which is easy to learn, interesting to read, and challenging to play. Fusil and Fortress is designed as a two-part game. Sections one through nine contain the rules required to play the tactical game, with Section three devoted to history, tactics, and organization. Sections ten through fourteen contain the rules for siege warfare, supply, engineering, and administration. Fusil and Fortress is not designed as a multi-level game in which you must learn more and more complicated rules. Once you have read the game, you can play it. We do this for two reasons. Our games are clearly written and our design staff feels that the wargamer has a lot more common sense than many games give him credit for. As an added bonus, Fusil and Fortress is designed to be played with or without an umpire.<br/><br/>We feel that Fusil and Fortress will be one of the most engaging games you have ever played. The reason for this is that all our designers are wargamers and understand problems with rules.<br/><br/>Designer's Notes<br/><br/>Because Fusil and Fortress is the first commercial wargame to effectively address warfare in the early 18th Century, the design staff felt that it was appropriate to discuss certain elements of game construction because of the radical departure from traditional game mechanics.<br/><br/>In most games, actual formations are sacrificed in order to cram the appropriate number of figures in the proper space. Thus, a one-deep line of figures may represent a two- or three-deep line of actual soldiers. While this method of game design may be perfectly acceptable for other eras, it would not be for the early 18th Century. Linear Infantry formations and numbers of ranks were of paramount importance and it would be impossible to use one rank of figures to represent more than one rank. Therefore, we have sacrificed a little space for accuracy and detail unknown in any other game. The upshot is that a unit will operate in the correct linear space in the proper number of ranks, but it will occupy an area slightly deeper than it actually would have. The rules have been formulated to mitigate this depth.<br/><br/>This unique design enables Fusil and Fortress to demonstrate the differences in the Dutch, Swedish, and French methods of musketry in a way you can actually see so that you can make them work the way they actually did.<br/><br/>The rules for artillery have also been designed to accurately represent the &quot;fall of shot&quot; and the occasional ricochet. The windage gauge is normally placed near the target which results in a smaller angular deviation of shot as the range increases. The inaccuracy of this method is obvious, and we have corrected it. Because of the design of the artillery firing system in Fusil and Fortress, no artificial additions for enfilade fire or other tactical advantages are needed.<br/><br/>The siege rules are a wargaming first and we do not believe that anything like them can be found anywhere. We have done everything possible to create in miniature the Vauban method of siegecraft and fortification. In conjunction with these unique combat and siege rules, we have also provided every last detail for engineering, supply, and administration, so that you can even &quot;pay&quot; your troops if you want to. You do not have to use all the information in Fusil and Fortress to have an exciting early 18th Century wargame, but when you do want information, it is there.<br/><br/>We feel that keeping these design differences in mind will help you understand the game better and enjoy it more. Good gaming.<br/><br/>",1977,,,

Each Marshal wants to develop the most prosperous town, one that President Lincoln himself would be proud to visit.<br/><br/>The three principal criteria that allow you to win the game are population growth, charm/attractiveness, and wealth, as measured by gold. Turns are regulated by the visits of Lincoln, who determines, bit-by-bit, the value of the towns relative to those three criteria. These criteria can and do change every round, and you will need to adapt to these changing criteria to win this game!<br/><br/>Each player has his own board on which he will be building his town. Every building gives him different, and increasing, rights and abilities, and therefore power. The bigger your town gets, the better &ndash; but managing too much growth is challenging, so you'll need to make difficult choices at the beginning of each round as to which buildings you'll bring into play.<br/><br/>This &quot;building-adding&quot; mechanism helps players stay in the game and not get lost in the overwhelming number of choices available. Of 22 different buildings, six of them are identified every round as &quot;bonus&quot; buildings, and players are forced to adapt varying strategies and test new combinations of these buildings for their town as the game progresses.<br/><br/>In addition to logic and strategy, Marshals will need to bluff and occasionally resort to questionably bending the law a bit, to succeed in building their Western Town.

The board is 8x8 for 2 players, 9x9 for three ones and 10x10 for four players. Each player has 6 money units at the beginning.<br/><br/>TURN ORDER:<br/><br/>1) The active player points at a spot on a map and puts the bid he wishes to pay for it (often it's just 0). The players in clockwise order may overbid each other. When the high bid stands - the winner loses the declared amount of money and becomes the active player since then. (It is possible to take a few turns in a row if one has enough money!)<br/><br/>2) Dice are rolled to determine if oil is present. A sum of 9 or more is required. But if there is some oil on any of the fields with a common border line with the one the check is performed for, the number is reduced by 1 for each such field. If the oil is present on the fields with common corner with the chosen one, 1 is subtracted from the required number for each 2 such fields. Thus to find oil on a field completely surrounded by other oil fields (very rare situation!) a player needs only to throw 3 or more.<br/><br/>3) If the oil is not present, the field is marked as an empty one. If it is peresent it is marked as an oil field belonging to the active player, and the active player receives 1 money unit for each point he rolled over the required minimum. Thus if there was 1 fileld nearby, and a sum of 8 was required but 10 was rolled, the active player receives 2 money units. Note that it is possible to find oil and get no instant reward!<br/><br/>4) The clokwise neighbor of the active player becomes one. Go to 1. :-) Game ends when all the fields are checked.<br/><br/>5) Each player receives 10 points for each oil field he owns and one point for each money unit he has got at the end of the game.

19449,Larven Freddy,"['Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']","['Animals', ""Children's Game""]","Children's game, probably from the early 1970's. Players compete to build the longest caterpillar from tiles depicting heads, body segments and tails. To do this they take turns spinning a plastic pointer. When it stops, it will point to either a head tile, a body tile or a tail tile. The player picks up a tile of the indicated kind and adds it to the caterpillar he is currently building in front of him. A complete caterpillar has a head, at least one body tile, and a tail. A player must complete his current caterpillar before beginning a new one. If his caterpillar needs a tail, and the pointer stops at a head or a body tile, he may not pick up a tile but must try again on his next turn. There is nothing players can do the affect the outcome. Longest caterpillar at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>There are 40 body tiles, 8 head tiles and 8 tail tiles. All heads are different but they are all happy faces, some with hats and so on. It doesn't really matter which heads you choose, but this may still seem important to young players. It is also the only decision players make.<br/><br/>Scandinavian edition Larven Freddy (&quot;Freddy the Caterpillar&quot;) was published by Brio under the Joker label, but the copyright belongs to John Waddington Ltd.

They also have a picture of an Indian with the name of a tribe (Potawatomi, Kiowa, Sioux, etc.) on the body, but for playing purpose, the tribes are irrelevant.  The score card consists of jutting triangles of different colors and boxed numbers in 5 colors.<br/>The arrow-heads are dealt out to players face down.  Each player in turn places an arrow-head on either the score card or a previously played arrow-head so that the color of the head matches the color of the tail it fits into, thereby creating a box of one color.  Players attempt to optimize their score by finding the match for their arrow-head that results in the largest available score on the score card.  The score is recorded each time an arrow-head is played.  If there is no available match for the player, he forfeits his turn, and must try again with the same arrow-head next turn.<br/>Play continues until all arrow-heads have been played.  The winner has the highest total.<br/><br/>",1940,,,

19462,Hor Lor Boon,"['Dice Rolling', 'Roll / Spin and Move']","['Dice', 'Racing']","The name of this traditional roll-and-move race game possibly derives from the hulu (Mandarin) or hor lor (Hokkien dialect), which means a gourd, that often appears as a symbol on the board. In the catalogue for the exhibition, Asian Games: The Art of Contest, the following names for this game are mentioned:<br/>hulu pan (gourd board) - southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong area<br/>hulu qi (gourd chess) in Hong Kong<br/>hulu wen (gourd puzzle)in Suzhou<br/>fenghuang qi (male and female phoenix chess)in places such as Tianjin, Weixian (Shandong Province), and Chengdu (Sichuan Province).<br/><br/>I know it, in Singapore, as Hor Lor Boon.<br/><br/>This game is played on a board showing a spiral track and the object is to move one's piece from the outside into the center of the track first(q.v. Game of Goose and Sheng Guan Tu). The track is made up of individual symbols which will be repeated once on the board. Players roll two dice and move the number of symbols along the track. Wherever they land, they will then jump to the corresponding symbol elsewhere on the board (which could be a help or a hindrance). It's not necessary to land exactly on the center square to win - passing it also wins.<br/><br/>The symbols may vary, but are usually traditional or mythological Chinese figures (e.g. the Eight Immortals, creatures from the Chinese zodiac) and would include a gourd (hor lor).<br/><br/>A contemporary set made in China called cai shen you xi qi (God of fortune game) has two pieces for each player - presumably the roll can only apply to one of the pieces in this version (the rules are not clear on this). The rules for this version state that if a piece is supposed to land on a space occupied by another piece, it remains where it is and the piece it would have landed on is sent back to the start. The board features the God of Fortune as the central space that all the players are trying to reach.<br/><br/>",0,,,

19524,Turning Point: The Battle of Freeman's Farm,"['Action Points', 'Hand Management', 'Simulation']","['American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame']","Published in 2005 by BSO Games (DTP), the description is from the GMT website, when it was on their p500 list.<br/><br/>It's Turning Point, a game covering the pivotal battle of Freeman's Farm, at Saratoga. It features all the units, from Morgan's Rifles to the British grenadiers, and all the dense, wooded terrain you would normally expect, but in a way you've probably not seen before.<br/><br/>The game uses two decks of cards, one deck for each player to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of his cards each turn, never his full deck, and his allotment is usually different (in terms of number and type) from his opponent. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and special items, such as Indian Stealth, Counter-Attack, Rifle Fire, and Rapid Movement, among others. Players may play as many cards as they wish when it's their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards &hellip; and the Turn is over.<br/><br/>Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the map of Freeman's Farm, which uses squares, rather than hexes,. You're still moving units, trying to outflank, attacking with what you hope are better odds (since you don't know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be), and using your cards, and wits, to outplay your opponent.<br/><br/>Turning Point was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

The game is played on two boards: the challenge board and the score track.  By advancing a marker on the challenge board, you can score points on the score track.  The first player to reach the end of the score track wins.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a &quot;push your luck&quot; dice mechanism to advance on the challenge board.  A player begins by rolling five dice, setting aside ones.  Other numbers can be used to advance a pawn along one of five columns, representing Looks, Faces, Tickles, Ouchies, and Teases.  After each roll, you can either stop or keep rolling.  If you stop and your pawn is the most advanced pawn in that column, then you remove any pawn it passed.  If it is not the most advanced, then you remove your pawn from the challenge board.  If your pawn has not been removed from the board by your next turn, then you score points for it on the score track.<br/><br/>You can keep rolling dice to advance your pawn farther up the challenge board, but when you accumulate three or more ones, your parents have caught you picking on your sibling.  Your turn ends and you lose points.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

They fought in Poland, they fought in France, they fought in Norway, they fought in Britain, they fought in North Africa, they fought in Italy, they fought in Russia, and finally, they fought in Germany, all the way into Berlin and the Brandenburg Gate. They fought in the air, they fought on the seas, they fought on the land, and they fought behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>They had hoped that their unwavering opposition to the Axis would earn them the right to freedom after the war.

The players have the option to place a Daily Double bet, which in this game is betting that the player's own horse will win the first two races. The players, one at a time, play a movement card.  Most of the movement cards specify a number of spaces to move the player's horse pawn. Some of the movement cards state, &quot;Ask Jockey&quot;.  &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; means that the player turns over the top card of the &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; deck.  The Ask Jockey cards are marked on their backs with a blue dot if the card has advantages for the player, red dot for disadvantages for the player, question marks ?? for instructions that may or may not affect the player that plays it.  Holding an Ask Jockey card until that deck has a card with a blue dot on top is ideal. After the players have put into play and discarded all of the cards dealt, the entire movement deck is shuffled and four more cards are dealt to each player. &quot;Ask Jockey&quot; cards can require a player to give a number of his movement cards to another player or just discard them without using them.  Therefore, players may use more or less than four movement cards per hand dealt. After the second race is complete, the Program cards are shuffled and dealt for each race.  The race track board is proportionally marked for all of the common lengths of horse races.  A game is complete after an agreed upon number of races and the instructions recommend 8 races.

The game is a wonderful way to learn the number system of the Nim&iacute;ipuu, counting from n&aacute;aqc (one) to le'dptit (twenty), and have a lot of fun doing so!<br/><br/>To play the game, you need two sets of game sticks, each set colored a different color, e.g., blue and red, and each set marked indicating a &aacute;ayet (male) and hamma (female), a &quot;couple.&quot; The male stick is often marked with an extra perpendicular line across it. The reverse side of a stick is called, caya, &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>Before starting the players agree upon the number of points to win, the higher the number, the more challenging and the more fun. Typically, 5, 7 or 11 point totals are selected. Usually starting with the youngest player and proceeding to that person's right, each person throws the four game sticks onto the rug before them. Depending on how the sticks land, the following points are possible.<br/><br/>* one &quot;couple,&quot; a &aacute;ayet and a hamma of the same color = one point<br/><br/>* two &quot;couples,&quot; both sets of &aacute;ayet and a hamma sticks = three points<br/><br/>* one &aacute;ayet and two hamma = two points. This combination refers to the Nim&iacute;ipuu practice of looking after a male friend's wife should he fall in combat.<br/><br/>* if there are no pairs matched, e.g., &aacute;ayet and a hamma of differing colors = no points<br/><br/>* but if all the sticks land caya, &quot;nothing&quot; = all points accumulated are lost and the player starts over.<br/><br/>After deciding on the win point total, be it 5, 7, or 11, the players need to agree on other rules. Will you need to win on the exact number, be it 5, 7 or 11, not going over that total?

19632,The Invasion of Sicily,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Dice', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","This fine game was published in 1972 in Panzerfaust magazine, with an unmounted map in four sections, unstapled rulebook in two sheets, and unmounted two-sided counters -- one of the very first (if not the first) wargames to use two-sided counters for step reduction. Fortunately, a mounted die-cut set of counters was available for like $1 additional, so we were spared the nightmare of trying to hand-mount two-sided counters &lt;shudder&gt;.<br/><br/>The Mapsheet consists of four sections (mine are hand-glued into one map) showing the island of Sicily, in light and dark blue and light and dark brown on white paper, 19&quot; x 27&quot; assembled. The Combat Results table (from 1-4 to 7-1), Terrain Effects chart (six types), Time Record track (12 four-day turns), Unit Designations Within Divisions chart (initial Axis), German Order Of Battle chart (reinforcements and &quot;What If?&quot; units), and Allied Order of Battle chart (initial and reinforcements) are all printed on the mapsheet. The starting Axis locations for the historical scenario are printed on the map, as are the historical and alternate Allied landing sites.<br/><br/>The Rulebook assembles into 8 pages. Front is picture, title and credits. Second page is historical info (&quot;Introduction&quot;). The next four pages are rules and victory conditions. Then 1/2-page of (six) alternate scenarios, 1/2 page of designer's notes, and 1/2-page of bibliography (on the last page, with instructions for assembling the mapsheet).<br/><br/>Units are mostly regiments and brigades (or similarly-sized kampfgruppen), with some battalions, some Italian divisions, and an Army HQ for each army (4). There are 120 of the 1/2&quot; counters -- 22 Americans (olive green, 3 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 18 British and Canadians (dark olive green, 1 is Army HQ), 39 Italians (yellow, 3 are divisions, 11 are battalions, 1 is Army HQ), 25 Germans (tan, 1 battalion, 1 Army HQ), and 16 blanks, some of each color. The mounted counters are unique in that the full-strength side is printed on what is normally considered the back of the counter. While it doesn't look as nice, it does actually facilitate handling the counters - they are easier to pick up. Another idea that never caught on.<br/><br/>This is not a complex game, more along the lines of the old Conflict games. The game sequence is 1. Allied airdrops; 2. Allies move; 3. Allied combat and post-combat moves; 4. Axis airdrops; 5. Axis moves; 6. Axis combat and post-combat moves. ZOCs are fluid for movement and rigid for combat. Combat is odds-based, with step losses, retreats and advances indicated for both attacker and defender. For example, at 1-1 odds, the results are: 1. Att 1 step retr 1, Def adv 1; 2. Att 2 steps retr 2, Def adv 1; 3. Att 1 step, Def 1 step retr 1; 4. no effect; 5. Def retr 1; 6. Def 1 step, retr 2. Stacking is 3 regt/brig. Rules for invasions, airdrops, supply, evacuations, and naval support fire are all simple and non-cluttered.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect is Italian desertion. On turn one, the Axis player must roll for every Italian non-infantry unit, losing it to desertion on a 3-6 on 1D6. The Italian infantry are sturdier, and will not desert unless attacked at 3-1 or more with no German unit within three hexes.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are based on three elements: Italian desertion, casualties, and cities held. Levels of victory are: Axis wins if he has more than 3/4 of Allied points, decisively if equal or more; game is drawn if Axis has less than 3/4 but at least 2/3 of Allies points; otherwise Allies win. Also, the Axis win immediately if they destroy both the US 7th Army and UK 8th Army HQs (not bloody likely).<br/><br/>I can't believe no one ever listed this game before. It is one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>",1972,,,

Players collect as many Math Cards as possible (each card has a point value printed in the center). The secondary objective is to use up all of your Math Cards before the other players can use up all of theirs. Once a player uses all of his or her cards, the game ends, and points are tallied. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>There are many ways to set this game up, to accommodate different levels of math skill of the players. The Spinner can be used in the center of the board to determine the target equation&rsquo;s solution or it can be removed so that the target solution is always 21.  Or,  take away the multiplication and division operators, so that less skilled players only have to think about adding and subtracting.

19656,The Impossible Game,['Dice Rolling'],[],"Roll dice as few times as possible to match symbols shown on the game board. Symbols must be matched in rows of six. Rows must be across or up and down. Each row of symbols must be matched in not more than 3 rolls of the dice per turn.<br/><br/>A player who has filled a row of symbols picks up the six dice and places a strip of cardboard over that row of symbols and continues to play, attempting to match dice with symbols in any of the remaining rows.  The same player continues to play as long as he can complete an uncovered row of symbols.  As rows are filled (or covered) the game becomes more challenging.  Filling a row in the three rolls becomes more difficult.  If a player does succeed in covering all the rows without ever giving up the dice, he has achieved the IMPOSSIBLE.<br/><br/>",1968,,,

Results are situation specific; thus a play with one out will turn out differently depending on whether there are runners on 1st base, 2nd, 3rd, or none on.  Each card also has two orientations, with a different set of play results on each side.<br/><br/>The game was marketed in conjunction with The Sporting News magazine.

Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.  Steeped in the ancient legends of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic heritage and royal past, these unique games of pure strategy are appreciated by young and old alike.<br/><br/>Tailten Games won the Games Magazine award for BEST ABSTRACT GAME 2006; the  Spiele f&uuml;r Zwei - Spiele Akademie 2005 (Austria); Index 100 - Showcase 2005 in Ireland; and the award for 'Best Irish-Style Traditional Gift' 2005 in Ireland for Project Kells.<br/><br/>According to the designer, Murray Heasman,&quot;The game takes five minutes to learn, yet a lifetime to master.&quot; The sheer beauty of this game alone makes it a gift to treasure--but the three separate games  each pose a daunting task for any strategic or abstract gamer.<br/><br/>In all there are eight variants to stimulate the mind, so take it to your own level.  From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.<br/><br/><br/>     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===<br/>     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.<br/><br/><br/>This is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

19667,Advanced Tactics,['Secret Unit Deployment'],['Card Game'],"This game has been described as &quot;glorified War,&quot; but that description is almost entirely misleading.  Advanced Tactics uses one standard deck of cards for each player. The players battle over pairs of cards face up on the table, and draw three cards that are used to augment the strength of one or more of the pairs of cards in play. Clubs count as negative points, and diamonds require another card to be drawn for that column. The object of the game is not to simply win more cards, but to win &quot;point cards&quot;. Point cards start with the Aces, then move to Kings when all of the Aces are claimed, and so on. Play is continued until all points are claimed through a pre-agreed goal (for example, if playing to Queens, then the game will end when all Aces, Kings, and Queens are claimed). The player with the most point cards wins. This makes for interesting longer-term strategy as well as the obvious short-term strategy of winning the current cards on the table.<br/><br/>Complete rules for this game are in the July 2007 issue of Knucklebones magazine.

Never before have the people and nations of the world been drawn closer together.  Modern technology, transportation, communications, economics and politics - all have played a part in the creation of our Global Village.<br/>The four map-related games in this series have been designed to interest students in their world.  Students start by learning the geography of a small community,  then move on to explore the United States, the Western Hemisphere, and ultimately the world.  Along the way, students practice a battery of skills useful for the understanding of any map.  In addition, the challenging, action-oriented games will convince students that exploring their world is more than a necessity, it can be a pleasure.<br/><br/>Educational Objectives:  Students become familiar with the basics of directionality, distance and scale, geographical detail and problem solving.<br/><br/>The &quot;Exploring Your World&quot; Geography Games set consists of four (4) games created to provide meaningful and interesting experiences for students in the instruction and application of geography and map reading skills.  The four games, and the instructional objectives of each are:<br/>City Limits - Directionality, distance and scale, land formation, transportation modes, and problem solving.<br/>States Race - Position and shape of the 48 continental United States, capital cities, time zones, geographical and cultural landmarks.<br/>Hemisphere Hunt - Principles of latitude, longitude, political divisions, national capitals and natural resources as they relate to the Western Hemisphere.<br/>World Wiz - World time zones, latitude and longitude, continents, the International Date Line, the Greenwich Prime Meridian, topographical and meteorological world conditions.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

19722,With Hostile Intent,[],"['Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']","From the designer:<br/><br/>With Hostile Intent is a table-top starship combat game where players using fleets of starships, ranging from a few vessels to large squadrons, battle each other using strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>The game uses an inertia/vector based movement system and is hex-less - meaning ship placement and movement is not constrained to a location on a hex map or other specific playing surface. Movement and orientation are kept track of in three dimensions using a simple and intuitive (math-less) method of dealing with line of sight, along with easily understood indicators on the ship control sheets. Range determination is performed simply by measuring distance with a tape measure and checking a chart, to take into account altitude.<br/><br/>Damage is tracked through a common damage-box method with damageable systems individually represented, along with hit location charts on the ship control sheets. Weapon information is likewise available on the ship control sheets.<br/><br/>Aside from the 3D aspects of the game, here are some features in development which are not commonly found in starship combat games:<br/><br/>Computer Warfare - the ability for ships to infect enemy vessels with computer viruses, jam missile guidance systems, or even steal control of enemy weapons or systems.<br/><br/>Crew Levels - A ship may drop out of a fight if it takes too many losses to its crew.<br/><br/>Damage Control - Ships can make limited battlefield repairs, things like bringing a damaged weapon back online or getting a thruster to work again.<br/><br/>Fires - Ships can catch fire, fires can spread, and crew members can be sacrificed when fires are vented to space.<br/><br/>Fuel and cargo - Makes for a wider range of possible scenarios as well as a seamless tie-in to campaign games.<br/><br/>Adaptable Game System - While the game will provide its own exciting universe, from the ground up it is being designed with the intent that others can adapt it to their favorite universe with relative ease. Having this foundation will also give the game and its setting the ability to grow without the system falling apart or failing in some regard.<br/><br/>WHI will be consistent and predictable with its ability to simulate movement in space, but it will not be a rigid simulation or necessarily be mathmatically accurate. It will be relatively quick and easy to play but will not be simplistic. It will have a lot of detail suitable for a wide range of battle sizes as well as adaptation to other gaming applications (roleplaying, campaigns, etc), but will avoid being tedious or micromanagerial.<br/><br/>The goal is for the game to be fun to play, first and foremost.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

19761,FIRE The Exciting Game of Firefighting,"['Cooperative Game', 'Simulation']",['Fighting'],"FIRE puts one or more players in the role of a city fire department chief or battalion chief in a department.<br/><br/>The mounted board is an 18 x 15 inch representation of an urban environment including streets and alleys, business and residential districts, industry and fire stations.  Structures are color-keyed green for low buildings and blue for multistory.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are squares and rectangles of 3/8&quot; plexiglass.  Self-adhesive colored stickers are applied producing lime-green miniature fire command vehicles, rescue ambulances, fire engines and ladder trucks.<br/><br/>The standard game is 24 turns long, represent a 24-hour shift.  Each turn, a die roll determines whether zero, one, or two alarms are received.  Each building on the map is marked with a street address.  Every time an alarm is received, a label corresponding to a board location is drawn randomly, indicating the site of the alarm.<br/><br/>An alarm may be indicated as a &quot;medical emergency, a &quot;call&quot; (corresponding to a &quot;local alarm&quot; in many fire departments) or a &quot;1st Alarm&quot; (potentially, a more serious situation).<br/><br/>The controlling Player determines which assets to dispatch to the scene depending on nature of incident and location.  Responses range from a single rescue ambulance for a medical emergency up to a multi-station response for a multistory structure, row house with multiple exposures or industrial complex.<br/><br/>Each game-turn is broken down into three impulses.  Each impulse, emergency vehicles may move up to eight squares toward a scene.  Physical space limitations often play a role, since alleys are only one square wide.  Pumpers take up two squares, ladder trucks three, making traffic control important when placing apparatus (particularly ladder trucks, which must be within reach of the structure in question).<br/><br/>Beginning in the second impulse, as long as at least one unit has arrived the controlling player may attempt to resolve the incident.  Resolution may determine that the call is a false alarm, that the fire has been extinguished, or that it continues to burn or intensifies.  At the player's discretion, he may wait until the third impulse before resolving the situation, in order to allow more assets to arrive.<br/><br/>Each unit type has a points value representing its firefighting capabilities.  Certain combinations of units--such as two engine companies, a truck company, and a chief officer--have a higher value than the face value of the units present, representing the fire ground tactics such combinations make possible--primary and secondary search, fire suppression, water supply, ventilation, exposure protection, fire ground command, etc.<br/><br/>The point total of firefighting assets present is cross-indexed to a die roll on the &quot;Results Table&quot; and an outcome determined.  Fires not extinguished at the end of the game-turn intensify one level (defined in the game as &quot;1st Alarm, 2nd Alarm,&quot; etc. through &quot;5th Alarm&quot;).  Fires of 2nd Alarm intensity or greater spread to adjacent spaces, either to a neighboring building or to additional spaces within a single large structure.  Poorly placed fire apparatus may also be destroyed by expanding fires.<br/><br/>Each new game-turn the alarm determination process is followed, meaning that new incidents may be generated.  It is important to hold some department assets in reserve to allow for responses to additional incidents.  The entire department numbers one &quot;Marshal&quot; (Chief of Department), three Battalion Chiefs, twelve Engine Companies, five Ladder Companies and six Rescue Ambulances distributed in six stations of various sizes.  Relocation of uncommitted assets is sometimes necessary to maintain adequate fire protection during major fires.<br/><br/>Rules cover wind direction, firefighter injuries, apparatus breakdown or other loss while responding, and, optionally, water supply.<br/><br/>The goal of FIRE is to maintain public safety at the lowest possible level of asset activity.  At the end of each turn, points are assessed for each unit out of quarters, whether fighting a fire or returning from a call.  The object is to achieve the lowest possible score while efficiently handling emergencies--a balancing act between dispatching sufficient assets and using assets efficiently.<br/><br/>",1984,,,

There were a total of two sets of cards released for the game. The first, Arena, was released in January, 2006. The second set, Secret Origins, was released in October, 2006. Since then, there have been no official releases.<br/><br/>The COHCCG was designed to be a quick game. Rather than using a turn structure where each player takes multiple actions in a row, the game used an alternating action structure. This lead to faster and more interactive games. Each player was represented by a Hero card, which began play with 2 starting powers. As their action, a player had many choices, including:<br/><br/><br/>    Play a card, being:<br/>         a Sidekick<br/>         a Power that can be used by the Hero or a Sidekick<br/>         an Enhancement on a Power already in play<br/>         an Edge card with the keyword &quot;Action&quot; or &quot;React&quot;<br/>    <br/>    Activate a Power already in play<br/>    Move the Hero or a Sidekick<br/>    Search your draw deck for a Sidekick<br/>    Recharge your Powers<br/>    Play a Mission card<br/>    Use the Defeat text on a mission to complete it<br/>    Draw 2 cards<br/><br/><br/>Unless otherwise specified by the cards played, play continued until only one Hero remained, who was declared the winner.<br/><br/>In addition to the 33 Heroes available in Arena and the 22 Heroes available in Secret Origins, players could create their own hero using &quot;Paragon&quot; Hero cards. These cards allowed a player to create new combinations of powers that were not available on existing Hero cards. Players could either play solely with the Paragon Hero cards available in the Arena set, or go online to access the HeroBuilder which allowed players to create Hero cards in the same template as the already available Heroes, including a picture uploaded by the player.<br/><br/>After the game was discontinued, a fan community effort created the Hamidon set.  Although the generic Hero cards listed all power sets available to the archetypes at the time, it wasn't until The Hamidon set was developed that many of those power sets were codified for use.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Players acquire production companies, which produce goods (rice, spices, microwaveable meals, rubber, and oil), and shipping companies, which deliver goods to cities. As cities receive goods, they grow, increasing their demands. Production companies earn money for each good delivered to a city, up to the city's capacity, but they must pay shipping companies for the distance traveled, even if they end up losing money. Players can research advantages, like greater shipping capacity or the ability to merge companies, possibly stealing ownership of lucrative plantations or shipping routes by buying out other players.<br/><br/>Players keep their money hidden, trying to accumulate the most by the end of the third era. When only one type of a company is left, an era ends. New eras bring new cities, companies, and types of goods. At the end of the third era, the player with the most money wins. However, money earned from the last round of operations (selling/shipping goods) counts double, so it can be important to control the timing.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Can you catch the vilest and most numerous of rats and secure your position as a member of the King&rsquo;s loyal staff?<br/><br/>Goal of the game:<br/>The players will move from room to room trying to trap as many of the rats as they can, by using magic items and outmaneuvering their opponents.<br/>The rats have three point values depending on their degree of nastiness:<br/>    1: plain old rat<br/>    2: aggressive rat<br/>    3: diseased rat<br/>The rats also come in four colours:<br/>    black, white, grey, and brown.<br/>Most of the valuable rats are of black colour, followed by brown, grey, and white. This may lead some players to choose to pursue only black or brown rats in their quest. However, the Wizard is a strange sort and wants to use the rats of all colours for his potions and magic. He rewards players handsomely for having rats of each colour. Keeping in mind that the white rats are the least common, and the black rats are most numerous, it is the rat trapper who can balance the best of both strategies who will ultimately win the game.<br/>This game features a very innovative game board design: a northern cross section of the castle is one one side of the board, and the southern cross section of the castle is on the other side of the board, in such a way that the roofs are almost touching. Each room presented on the cross sections have doors leading east/west/both, but also have a door set into their back wall of the room which leads to the other side of the board and the other cross section.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Players roll to move around an intersecting track that includes a space for each state and spaces with instructions (Free TV, Major Fundraiser, Go to Home Region, Good News, Minor Set-Back, Minor Foul-Up, Major Disaster).<br/><br/>The states are divided into five regions, and ranked within each region. Players pick a region and roll for Home State on 2D6 within the region. When a player lands on an unclaimed state, it goes up for auction (with conditions). A player can grab another state in his home region for the minimum bid; if in another candidate&rsquo;s home region, it is a two-way auction with that candidate; otherwise all can participate. Landing on a controlled state requires paying money (more if the owner is there or it is part of a bloc of 7+ states in its region). Players can trade states and money at any time.<br/><br/>Players can win in one of four ways: Front Runner (majority of the 1500 total delegate votes); Regional Bloc (control 7+ states in each of 3 regions);  Key States (control 10+ of the 15 states ranked #1, #2 and #3 in their regions, including 2+ #1s); and Balanced National Appeal (control 5+ states from each of 4 regions).<br/><br/>After 1.5 hours, the game moves to a Convention round, where players not meeting minimum levels are eliminated, everyone gets bonus money and all auctions are open. After another 30 minutes, if no one has achieved one of the victory conditions, there is a Roll Call vote and most delegates wins.<br/><br/>",1976,,,

All tiles are divided into a black and white triangular half, with a landing space on each side for the playing piece of that colour. Tiles have a handle stuck in the middle that enables them to be lifted up, twisted round and replaced without the risk of having pieces slip off. Both the black and white player have 6 stones in their respective colours that start on opposite sides of the board. All tiles initially face the same direction, so that no two touching sides have the same colour and hence no &quot;connections&quot; exist on the board at the start of play.<br/><br/>By twisting tiles, players can create &quot;connections&quot; of identically coloured halves, creating a corridor along which pieces of that colour can progress. Each turn players either twist one tile in the aim to improve the available route, or move a stone along one of those routes. Players try to remove all stones in their colour from the other side of the board. The first to do so is the winner. A tile that has just been lifted gets a red marker on it. It prevents that tile from being turned by the player who is next. Additionally, it also prevents 1 or 2 neighbouring tiles from being turned, as long as a connection in that player's colour was created to the neighbouring tile(s) by the newly placed one.

The game features two types of question cards, for &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;adults&quot;. Players navigate around the circular board while answering timed questions. The &quot;kids&quot; questions are designed to be simpler and focus more on the more recent years of the show's history and characters or topics taught by Sesame Street. The &quot;adult&quot; questions tend to cover a more broad span of the show's history and characters. Questions are based mainly on characters and other &quot;on-screen&quot; information, and there is little attention given to behind-the-scenes or production information and history. There are multiple choice, single choice, and true or false questions. Some of the questions are accompanied by a picture of the relevant character or object.<br/><br/>",2004,,,
19833,Ironclad,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Pattern Building']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Ironclad is a commissioned game from Frank Lantz for the game design textbook &quot;Rules of Play&quot;, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.<br/><br/>Ironclad is played on a 6-by-8 checkerboard, using checkers on the spaces and go stones on the intersections.  The checkers represent battling armored robots, and the stones represent arguments in a philosophical disagreement between two logicians.  These two sub-games, battling robots and arguing philosophers, are played simultaneously on the same board.  You win by winning either sub-game.<br/><br/>In the robot sub-game, you start with your robots on your side of the board.  On each turn, you can either move a single robot or fire on an enemy robot with all the friendly robots that are within range.  You win if one of your robots reaches the opponent's side of the board.<br/><br/>In the philosophers sub-game, you attempt to make an unbroken string of stones in your color from one side of the board to the other.  On each turn, you place a single stone of your color, if possible. Otherwise, you move a single stone of either color.  If neither is possible, then your opponent wins.<br/><br/>The sub-games interact in two ways.  First, a stone cannot be played on the corner of a space containing a robot.  Second, if a space containing a robot has one or more stones on its corners, that robot receives a defensive bonus when attacked.<br/><br/>The most novel aspect of Ironclad lies in the choice of which sub-game to play in.  On each turn, a player makes two moves, one in each sub-game.  However, the player only gets to decide on the move in one of the sub-games.  The player's opponent gets to decide on the player's move in the other sub-game.  So the player chooses one of the sub-games and makes a move in that sub-game, then the opponent moves for the player in the other sub-game.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Each player is secretly assigned a role, either a Spork, a Foon, or the Sneak.  Only one player is the Sneak, the others are evenly divided between Sporks and Foons.  The goal is to figure out who is the Sneak.<br/><br/>The players perform a series of challenges.  Some of the challenges are private (written on a note card) and some are public.  The challenges typically direct Sporks and Foons to do different things (for example, draw a train vs draw a plane), and the Sneak gets to choose which one to do, except for certain challenges which tell the Sneak what to do.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with four counters, and they can use these counters to buy information.  For one counter, a player can require another player to show the entire group one of their written note cards.  For two counters, a player can purchase a private look at another player's note card.<br/><br/>Players can call for a vote at anytime, and each player writes down who they think the Sneak is.  Sporks and Foons get points for guessing correctly, or lose points for guessing wrong.

In the center is space for 3 plastic containers with a slot in the lid. Each player gets 2 pawns, 5 fuel chips in each of the 4 colours, and 3 sticks. Each player places their pawns on the board, one on each track, next to a dot of their colour. The aim of the game is to be the first player to return both pieces to their starting positions, moving one pawn round clockwise, and the other anti-clockwise.<br/><br/>It is a diceless game: players are in control of their own movement. Any unoccupied space can be reached as long as, and here&rsquo;s the twist, the player has enough &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; to reach that square. Remember those chips? For each square traveled, one chip has to be handed in. The landing space determines which colour those chips should be. Used chips are then put through the slots of the containers in the middle, spread between them at will. At the start of the game, each player only has enough chips to get one pawn round the board. To get both pieces round additional fuel need to be bought. During your turn, you can buy the hidden contents of one of the containers by discarding one of your three sticks. If you have run out of sticks and you haven&rsquo;t got the right chips left to get home than you are out of the game.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a lightweight but rather clever racing game for the entire family, but its diceless movement system sets it apart from most racing games aimed at this market.<br/><br/>Disposition was licensed from B.L.A. and published by Berliner Spielkarten in their &quot;Spiel-O-Thek&quot; range.<br/><br/>",1974,,,

Passes were attempted by positioning receiver figures down field, followed by the defense setting up coverage. The offensive player then tried to toss a Styrofoam football to one of the receivers using a passer/kicker figure with a spring-loaded arm.

Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.  Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.<br/><br/>Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leads a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.<br/><br/>The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

Two players (or teams of two) play either black or white footsteps.  The twelve playing cards are shuffled and dealt face down to both players.  Players alternatively play a card (which contains some holes) onto the board.  The object is to cover up as many of your own footsteps as possible whilst exposing your opponent&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>In the advanced game (3 to 4 players) each player chooses a role card to establish whether they are a detective or a murderer.  Before the start the 2 murderers must each decide on a board location to hide their victim.  They tell each other their location, one will be a white location and one a black location.  The detective(s), who are not told of the locations, will use the diagrams on the back of their cards to assist them identify the location of the bodies.  Each murderer alternatively places a playing card onto the board, but they must not alter the color or direction of the two hidden locations.  Each murderer will try to expose the other by changing as many of the opponent&rsquo;s steps as possible to help the detective with their eliminations.  When a detective has one location left un-eliminated he has caught the murderer.  If the caught murderer has played one less card than their opponent then the opponent can play one more card to try to salvage a draw.  The victorious detective and the uncaught murderer are the winners. <br/><br/><br/>",1988,,,

The players race to reach the ending space, depicting The Immortal Man.<br/><br/>RULES OF THE GAME (engraved in the centre of the playing surface)<br/><br/>The Immortal Man, who has existed 84 years, seems worthy of his Talents and Merit to become for the Close of Life, which can end only by Eternity. When we shall arrive at the No.84, we shall have gain'd all we can by this Game, but if we exceed this number, we must go back as many points as we have proceeded beyond it. <br/>The Age of Man is divided into seven periods of 12 years, viz. Infancy to Youth, Manhood, Prime of Life, Sedate Middle Age, Old Age, Decrepitude and Dotage. He passes through life in a variety of situations which are arrange in the order they generally succeed each other. <br/>This game like all others of the same kind is played with a totum, each Player spinning twice in his turn, the only difference is, that the Players cannot stop at any one of the seven ages, but must proceed as many points beyond, as they have in coming to them. Yet as they may spin at the first 2 sixes and consequently would go onto 84, which would be most improper, those who have this chance at first, must content them selves with going to the Historian at 39. <br/>The Studious Boy at 7 shall receive a Stake and shall proceed to 42, the place of the Orator. <br/>The Negligent Boy at 11 shall pay a Stake and shall remain two rounds without spinning. <br/>The Assiduous Youth at 15 shall receive 2 Stakes, and proceed to 55, where he will find the Patriot. <br/>The Triflet at 19 shall pay 1 Stake, and proceed to the Songster at 38. <br/>The Duellist at 22 shall pay 2 Stakes, and return to take the place of the Boy at Number 3. <br/>The Complaisant Man at 26 shall remain there, and let others play until another comes to take his place, and then he shall go back to the place of his liberator. <br/>The Prodigal at Number 30 shall pay four Stakes, and go back to the Careless Boy at Number 6. <br/>The Married Man at 34 shall receive two Stakes for his Wife's Portion and go to be a Good Father at 56. <br/>The Romance Writer at 40 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Mischievous Boy at 5. <br/>The Dramatist at 44 shall pay 4 Stars to the Masters of his Art and shall begin the game again. <br/>The Benevolent Man at 52 shall go to 78 to amuse himself with the Joker. <br/>The Temperate Man at 58 shall go to 82, to find the Quiet Man. <br/>The Drunkard at 63 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Child at 2. <br/>The Patient Man at 68 shall receive 2 Stakes and go to amuse himself with the merry fellow at 80. <br/>The Manhater at 71 shall pay 2 Stakes and go back to the Obstinate Youth at 16. <br/>The Old Beau at 74 shall receive 1 Stake and let each of the others play one round. <br/>The Satyrist at 77 shall pay 4 Stakes and go back to the Malignant Boy at 8. <br/>Lastly the Tragic Author at 45 shall go to the place of the Immortal Man at 84 and win the Game by Succeeding him.<br/><br/>DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS (engraved in the spandrels) <br/>1. The Utility and Moral Tendency of this Games. <br/>If parents who take upon themselves the pleasing task of instructing their children (or others to whom that important trust may be delegated) will cause them to stop at each character and request their attention to a few moral and judicious observations, explanatory of each character as they proceed and contrast the happiness of a virtuous and well spent life with the fatal consequences arising from vicious and immoral pursuits, this game may be rendered the most useful and amusing of any that has hitherto been offered to the public. <br/>2. Directions for Playing <br/>This game may be played by any number of persons at a time; but care must be taken, that each player makes use of a different mark to move with, and be provided with at least twelve counters each, and agree how much to value them per dozen. <br/>Let us then suppose that four gentlemen agree to play a game together, and stake four counters each. A takes red for his mark, B green, C black and D white. A begins and spins 9 and accordingly places his mark upon No. 9, which is the Docile Boy. B plays next and spins 7, but as the rules of the game specify instead of putting his mark on No.7, he must receive a counter from the pool, and carry his mark to the Orator, at No. 42. C being next in turn, spins only 2, and puts his mark on the place of the Child at No. 2. D being the last player spins 11, and goes to the Negligent Boy; but this being a forfeit, he must pay a counter to the pool and remain two rounds at No. 11 without playing in his turn. A now resumes the totum and spins 3, which brings him from No. 9 where he was to No. 12, but this being one of the seven ages, he cannot stop there, for agreeable to the rules of the game he must proceed as far beyond the age to No. 15, the place of the Assidious Youth; but instead of that he must receive 2 counters from the pool and go to No. 55, the place of the Patriot. B now takes the totum and spins 6, when being already at No. 42, the place of the Orator, he should naturally go to No. 48 but that being the age of the Sedate Man, he must proceed 6 points beyond 48 and put his mark on the place of the Vigilant Man at no 54. C's turn being but instead of stopping at this last number (according to the rules of the game) he pays a counter into the pool and goes to the place of the Songster at No. 38. D must as already mentioned also remain this round without playing. A again takes the totum and spins 2, and being before at No. 82 compleats No. 84 takes the place of the Immortal Man and wins the game.<br/><br/>NB. It is necessary to inform the Purchaser the Totum must be marked with the figures 1-6 and avoid introducing a dice box into private families, each player must spin twice, which will answer the same purpose.<br/><br/><br/>The playing sheet is numbered in an anti-clockwise direction starting from the lower left corner.

A good war game combines all the strategy of chess, all the fun of model railroading, and all the excitement and challenge of a game of baseball. Thanks to innovations in the manufacture of military miniatures, large numbers of excellent figures can now be obtained at very low cost. The result, in recent years, has been a dramatic upsurge in the popularity of war gaming.<br/><br/>Joseph Morschauser's How to Play War Games in Miniature explains every step in setting up and playing a table top war: how to obtain soldiers and their equipment; how to construct model terrain; how to deploy and maneuver troops; and how to fight battles which accurately reproduce the tactical conditions appropriate to any historic period from remote antiquity to the present.<br/><br/>Mr. Morschauser is an award-winning editor of one of America's greatest weekly magazines and a long-time war gamer.

The other half of the board is not used and can be folded under or used as a rolling surface for your dice. Each player starts the game with 16 pieces in six rows. Each row starts with three pieces in it, except the outside rows, which start with two. Each player's turn consists of the following steps: 1. Choose a row. 2. Roll a die. 3. Move pieces. The object is to 'leap' your pieces from your side of the board to the other player's side of the board and then to safety. The trick is that each die roll can only be used to move pieces on one row.<br/><br/>Play continues until all pieces controlled by a player have been removed from the board. The game ends immediately unless that player went first, in which case the other player gets one more turn to play. If the game ends with no pieces on the board, then the game is a draw. If one player has any pieces left on the board, then the other player wins.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

There are only 4 'holes' on the golf course; however, you can play 9 holes by using different combinations of tee-off locations and holes. The sample scorecard has the 'par' for each hole. Other equipment needed: a golf ball (marker) of a distinct color for each player, 2 D6 and paper and pencil to keep score (you can make or copy a scorecard for each player instead of using a plain piece of paper for scoring).<br/><br/>When a new hole is started, each player tees-off in turn. Until everyone finishes the hole, order of play is determined by whoever is farthest from the current hole. Whoever is farthest takes the next swing. On your turn, while you are on the fairway or rough, roll both dice. You must move your ball in a straight line (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as follows: (1) the total of both dice (2) the number on either die (3) the difference between the two dice.<br/><br/>Playing from a sand trap has a potential penalty. Play the stroke as usual, but then roll one die again. If it is a 1, there's no penalty. A 2, 3 or 4 adds one penalty stroke. A 5 or 6 adds two strokes.<br/><br/>Landing in a water trap incurs a two-stroke penalty, and you take your next swing from the last space you passed before landing in the water.<br/><br/>When you make it onto the proper green, you must decide whether you will (1) continue to use the movement method using 2 dice or (2) use a 'putter' (move the ball one square in any direction for each putt). You must continue to use this method for the rest of the hole.<br/><br/>There are a few more obstacles: (1) You may not hit onto or directly over an opponent's ball (2) You may not hit onto or directly over trees (3) You may not hit your ball onto a green other than the one around the hole you are playing.<br/><br/>Keep track of the number of strokes it takes you to complete a hole and write it onto your scorecard.

A surprise Confederate attack, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, nearly swept encamped Union defenders into the Tennessee River. The next day, a reinforced Union army counter-attacked and drove the CSA line back in confusion and retreat. A CSA victory might have ruined the career of General Ulysses S. Grant. Instead, the battle ended with a Union victory, the death of Johnston, and the eventual demise of Confederate hopes in the West. Days 1 and 2 can be played separately or together.<br/><br/>Shiloh was initially developed from the Gettysburg: Badges of Courage game system. However, the game mechanics have been completely overhauled. The map is divided into large areas and combat is resolved within areas. The game plays using the fast-paced Move-Move-Battle sequence seen in Hammer of the Scots and Julius Caesar. There are no cards involved; players activate leaders to command brigades of the same division or corps. The game plays smoothly and quickly; each player gets to play one day on offense and one day on defense for a great gaming experience.

The game combines detailed individualized players cards for every player position with specific offensive and defensive play calls to generate action.<br/><br/>Here is a brief description of play from the manufacturer's web-site:<br/><br/>First, let&rsquo;s set the scene. It&rsquo;s the first round of the playoffs, with Miami hosting New England. Miami&rsquo;s got the ball on the New England 37 yard line with 4:23 to go in the fourth quarter. They&rsquo;re down by a touchdown.<br/><br/>The Miami coach selects a passing play, &ldquo;F1 Cross&rdquo; (F1 is the flanker, and he&rsquo;s running a crossing pattern over the middle of the field).<br/><br/>The play card is essentially a 3&rdquo; x 5&rdquo; card filled with information about the ensuing play. The larger letters (s, T, G, C, Q, etc.) represent offensive players. The boxes and ovals represent defensive zones which may or may not be occupied by one or more defensive players. The lines represent the routes each of the offensive players takes after the snap. The red line represents the route taken by the intended receiver. Blue lines represent secondary receivers, while black lines represent the motion taken by blockers.<br/><br/>The smaller letters are the player ratings, which are followed by a number or range of numbers, which correspond to a 20-sided (d20) die.<br/><br/>So let&rsquo;s roll the dice and see what happens&hellip;<br/><br/>20 sided die = 2 <br/>12 sided die = 6<br/>2 six sided die roll = 1+3 = 4<br/><br/>The d20 roll (2) tells us what the matchup is. In this case, the left guard is matched up against the defender in the zone opposite him (in this case, the right defensive tackle).<br/><br/>Here are the two players involved on the play:<br/><br/>J. Buckley [G - Miami 97]<br/>Hen. Thomas [DT - New England 97]<br/><br/>The offensive player&rsquo;s &ldquo;D&rdquo; rating (pass blocking) is now compared to the &ldquo;B&rdquo; rating (pass rush) of the defensive player&rsquo;s. These two ratings are subtracted (6 &ndash; 4 = 2) and compared to the d10 (in this case, a 6 was rolled). Since 6 is larger than 2, the defensive player wins the matchup.<br/><br/>Now, the two d6 are added together (1 + 3 = 4). Since Thomas won the matchup, we look under his &ldquo;B&rdquo; column across from &ldquo;4&rdquo; and find the result code of &ldquo;47&rdquo;. This is a sack! (Result codes are listed on the field&hellip;there are approximately 90 of them.)<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s it! All other plays are completed in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

Only if the last bean will land in the pot, a player may pick up all beans from a cup instead, and sow these.

The game comes in a tin box and contains: 224 cards, wooden pieces, 1 plastic chip and rules.<br/><br/>The game is designed in German and English. One deck has German and English topics, such as Clothing, Holidays, Politics, Ancient Egypt and so on. The deck is written in German and English. The other deck has some letters to start a word and some letters to end a word. So a card might have PE... and ...ING, or it might have T... and ...E and so on. Players have six of these cards face-up in front of them. Three of the Topic cards are dealt up for all to see and then a letters card is turned up.<br/><br/>As quickly as you can, you make a word fitting one of the topics, starting or ending with a card in your six, and starting or ending with the table card. That is, if you use one of your cards to start a word, then you use the ending from the table card. Or the other way round: if your word starts with the table card, then you use an ending from one of your six.<br/><br/>The game has two decks for the letters, one in English, one in German. That way, you get the right kind of starting and ending letters to suit your language.<br/><br/>Players put markers on the Topics with a correct choice, and flip their card they used (worth one point), and draw a fresh table card. When any Topic card gets a third marker, that player gets the Topic card face down (worth three points) and a fresh Topic is drawn. When any player is down to one letter card, there's a special speed round, then the players reset their cards. The game ends after the third speed round.<br/><br/>It is a simple game idea and yet very challenging to find words and then find how to fit them to the letters available. But after a while, you can get into the flow and the game moves very quickly.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

Players may move their opponent's pieces as well as their own. Players can re-claim captured pieces (when playing with dice). The game can also be played without dice as a pure abstract strategy game - suited to advanced players who are interested in a deeper more serious game.

If the meat eaters are boarded with plant eaters, you won't have those plant eaters around by the time the water recedes.

Your goal is to place your animal tokens (as victory points) based on characteristics of the animal and provision cards loaded on the &quot;ark&quot;.  Each player takes turns either placing cards or drawing cards from a face-up draft pile (Card Drafting) and the supply stack.  Each card has characteristics (such as the animal size, diet, climate, scoring category, and special ability).  Animals and provisions must be placed according to rules that prevent animals from eating each other, eating the supplies, or tipping the &quot;ark&quot; with their combined weight.  When a card is played, the player may place a &quot;victory point&quot; animal token on one of the 5 scoring category cards.  In this way, the game combines Tile Placement of the cards with Set Collection for types of victory points.  The game ends when a fifth &quot;Rain Card&quot;, somewhat randomly shuffled into the deck, is drawn.

It is played on a special plastic board which contains seven recessed areas that allow a chip to be placed face-up and six slots that hold a chip invisibly.  The board is arranged with a single recess at the center surrounded by an alternating pattern of recesses and slots.<br/><br/>There are several different ways to play:  a basic game, two levels of advanced play, a children's version, and a variety of optional rules.  All follow the same basic theme:  after the board is set up with chips in some or all of the recesses and slots, players take turns drawing a chip for the center recess and looking for patterns of chips (generally lines or triangles) containing runs of consecutive numbers.  When a player spots a pattern on his or her turn, he or she takes one of the non-central chips from the pattern and moves the chip from the center of the board into the vacated spot.  If the player cannot find a pattern, the center chip is instead taken off the board as a &quot;dead chip&quot; that can be played later in place of a random draw.  Single-ring chips are wild, and double-ring chips allow other chips to be stolen from opponents.

Dealer (first to draw and discard) rotates clockwise.  Only cards of the same suit (see variation) count toward your point total. Players take turns to draw the top card from either the stock or the discards, then discard a card. In replacement for drawing and discarding, any player can &ldquo;knock&rdquo;, signifying that each player then has one more turn to draw and discard.  When the turn returns to the &ldquo;knocker&rdquo;, then all players lay down their cards and announce their total.  The lowest score discards a token/coin.  In the event of a tie for lowest score, all lowest scoring tied players discard a token/coin.  At any time, if a player collects 31 points (A, and two face cards or ten), then they immediately lay down their cards and announce &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; or &ldquo;31&rdquo;, and all other players discard a token/coin.

There are also four baseball players used to represent the batter and any runners.  The spinner points you to several tables located around the edge of the board.<br/><br/>The player who is the pitcher spins the spinner to determine what kind of pitch will be thrown (fast ball, slow ball, curve ball or knuckle ball).  The batter then decides whether or not he wants to &quot;take&quot; the pitch, or make a swing at it.  If he takes the pitch, the result can be either a ball or a strike, though the pitcher could also incur a passed ball, wild pitch, balk, or a hit batter.<br/><br/>If the batter swings at the pitch, he spins the spinner to get a numerical result, and reads the result based upon the pitch thrown.  This result could be either a strike, a ball, a foul, a hit to the infield, or a hit to the outfield.<br/><br/>If the result is a hit, the batter spins the spinner again and reads the result on the appropriate infield hit or outfield hit chart, with the result being some type of base hit or out.<br/><br/>With runners on base, the batter can also announce to attempt a stolen base or a sacrifice.  In this case he, surprise!, spins the spinner and reads from the appropriate chart.<br/><br/>Continue this way, playing nine innings of regulation baseball.<br/><br/>",1964,,,

It gets rather crowded on the icebergs. Quite fast, some of the icebear friends glide down to the the water. But, with some skill you can help the friends get the best spot in the sun. This requires a steady hand, to place your cards firmly on the ice berg.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of cards, some counters and two icebergs (three dimensional cardboard stands). At the beginning of each game, each player receives a number of cards, of which three are face up. Each turn a player tries to get rid of one of his face up cards. This is done by placing the cards on one of the icebergs. How exactly the card is to be placed is determined by the animal depicted on the card. Some cards need to be placed against a side of the iceberg, others need to be on top, etc. In some cases, it is not the card that needs to be placed, but a cardboard counter (using the card as a tool).<br/><br/>If a player succeeds in placing his card, he draws a new card from his pile and puts it next to his other face up cards. However, if one or more cards fall down while he tries to place his cards, half of the cards that have fallen down are shuffled and put on his draw pile (the others are discarded).<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",2005,,,
