The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.<br/><br/>Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.<br/><br/>Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.<br/><br/>The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:<br/><br/>The Eye (covers 1 square);<br/>    The Rod (covers 2 squares);<br/>    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);<br/>    The Snake (covers 4 squares);<br/>    The Door (covers 5 squares);<br/>    The Gun (covers 6 squares).<br/><br/>",1977,,,

Each player plays these tiles alternatively until they have all been played. Movement is made by following the arrows, and avoiding the neutral zone in the middle. The game ends when one player reaches his goal or when both players cannot make legal moves.<br/><br/>The key game mechanism is that your move options are determined not by the three arrows on the tile under your (transparent) game piece, but by those under your opponent's piece. Thus, each move is chosen to try and limit your opponent's next as well as to try and guarantee yourself a good selection of choices.

2061,A Line in the Sand: The Battle of Iraq,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Negotiation', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Modern Warfare', 'Political', 'Wargame']","This is a game detailing the Persian Gulf War fought in the early 1990's. Many of the mechanics are similar to that of one of TSR's other wargames (Red Storm Rising) so players of that game can rather easily go to this game.<br/><br/>Two versions of this game are played. With less than 5 players, the game is a &quot;Basic Game&quot; where military might is what wins the game. Players take sides, usually a combination of Middle Eastern nations plus the US. In the two player version, for instance, it is (quite predictably) the US &amp; Allies vs. Iraq; in the three-player game &quot;Holy War&quot;, it's Israel vs. Iraq (and Yemen and Jordan) vs. Saudi Arabia (and Syria, Libya, and Lebanon), and so on.<br/><br/>Combat rules are rather straightforward, and wargamers will be familiar with many of the mechanics. Land (w/ infantry, Iraqi National Guard, and tanks), sea, and air units are all utilized. Most units can take a few hits before removed from the board.<br/><br/>The *real* game, though, is the six-player diplomatic game. The players are now clearly defined: The US (NATO), Iran, Israel, Iraq/Yemen, Moderate Arabs (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, etc.), and Volatile Arabs (Jordan, Libya, etc.) This adds a crucial element of diplomacy and politics, and makes the game much more interesting than the normal wargaming stuff. A &quot;War Fever&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot; marker change as nations do things--for instance, the first time a US unit is attacked outside of Turkey, War Fever &quot;tripwires&quot; to 10. If Israel attacks a neighbor, Jihad increases by 2. War Fever and Jihad permit certain things to happen--for instance, if War Fever gets too low, the US is restricted in whom they may attack. If Jihad hits either 1 or 10, revolutions may occur--which can switch entire nations to another player!<br/><br/>Messages can be sent to other players via a diplomatic pouch--you cannot simply pull another player to the side and whisper in their ear. All messages, once read, go into a big pouch, and players can make diplomatic gestures to read some of the messages after they're read.<br/><br/>Victory occurs, in any case, when you meet objectives, which can vary from player to player. &quot;War Aim&quot; chits are drawn before the game begins, and so players are not quite certain as to exactly what other players are going for. For Instance, Iraq may win if they capture and hold Kuwait for the last three turns; if Jihad has reached 10 at least once and 10 non-Muslim units have been destroyed (by anyone); or by controlling three more oil fields than they started with. It all depends on what they looked for.<br/><br/>All in all, the Diplomatic game changes the basic game so much that political considerations are as important as military ones.<br/><br/>A simplified version of the game with the same name appeared in the TSR comic Warhawks #3. Advanced scenarions for the game in the comic appeared in Warhawks #4.<br/><br/>",1991,,,
2062,Deal Me In,"['Hand Management', 'Square Grid', 'Tile Placement']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Briefly: Scrabble with poker hands.<br/><br/>Deal Me In is a board game in which players collect tiles (which represent playing cards) and attempt to lay them on the board so as they form poker hands. The higher the hand, the greater the score. The poker hands interlock in the same way as the words on a scrabble board, so it`s possible to score for more than one hand on a turn. When a player scores, he/she takes score chips from the box. the player with the highest scoring number of chips when the cards run out is the winner.<br/>Simple, fast and fairly enjoyable; but very lightweight. An opener/closer.<br/><br/>The bits: One board, comprising an 11x11 grid. most of the spaces are blank, but some have representations of playing cards on them; these are bonus squares, a la scrabble.<br/><br/>56 &quot;playing cards&quot;. These are actually good quality cardboard tiles.<br/><br/>30 No Entry tiles.<br/><br/>4 playing racks<br/><br/>Poker chips in various denominations<br/><br/>Each player starts with chips worth 150 and 7 tiles. These are placed in the playing rack.<br/>the four joker tiles are laid on the Joker squres on the board.<br/><br/>Players must, on their turn lay at least one card on the board to form a legitimate poker hand, or failing that change one or more tiles at a cost of 10 per tile.<br/><br/>Tiles laid must extend hands already played, again in the same way as scrabble. <br/>Players do not have to lay five cards at a time. For example, a player could form four of a kind simply by laying three tiles of the same denomination next to a previous tile with that denomination.<br/><br/>bonuses are scored by laying tiles on the special bonus squares on the board. Again, these squares have representations of playing cards on them and in order to score, you must lay the tile of the same denomination as the bonus square in order to score.<br/>When a five card poker hand has been formed on the board, it can no longer be extended, so a No Entry tile must be laid at either end of the hand to stop any further tiles from being added.<br/>If a hand is played so it covers a Joker tile, this tile is taken up and added to the players` hand.<br/>If a Joker is laid as part of a hand, it may be replaced with the correct tile which it represents on a later turn.<br/>When a player lays a hand down, he/she takes poker chips to the value of the hand. This varies from 10 for a pair, to 1000 for a royal flush.<br/>When the cards run out, scores are totted up and the player with the highest value in chips is declared the winner.<br/><br/><br/>",1988,,,
2063,The Great Khan Game,"['Area Movement', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Melding and Splaying']","['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Medieval']","The Great Khan Game includes one 32-page rule book, one 11&quot; x 17&quot; full-color map of the Whamite Isles, 120 die-cut cardboard playing pieces, 162 playing cards, and one plastic storage bag.<br/><br/>This is a card/strategy board game for 2 or more players.  The game is set in the Whamite Islands.  It is a very fun game, which usually lasts an hour or so depending on the number players and chance.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to make as much gold as possible by controlling countries within your own little empire from the dozen or so provinces available.  The game uses a card system with a lot of clever design tricks added on to provide depth.<br/><br/>The game play within your turn is easy to pick up, but requires much thought to get right. You are dealt six cards initially, which will usually give you weak control of a couple of countries. These can be added to each turn by drawing two free cards or taking the top card from the discard pile. Additionally, you can buy extra cards every turn.  Having checked the cards for events and acted on those immediately, you can make 'melds,' war and political manoeuvres before compulsorily discarding one card.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the 'meld.' A meld is simply the act of laying one or more cards from your hand in front of you, thus activating their powers. By having the most powerful political meld on the table (determined by the total number of flags on the melded cards), you control that country until toppled by better politics or combat. Each country normally has a couple of leaders, often with low numbers, and a varying number of higher-numbered followers who might be loyal to any leader card or just one.<br/><br/>Power can be stolen in two ways: political coups where you lay more flag cards than are currently melded (you take over those cards as well - those willing rally to your cause), or by the time-honoured invasion force.<br/><br/>Combat is simple enough, but can prove a little fiddly at times. Once battle is joined, a d6 is rolled to see how many rounds the battle will last. Rolling a one when there are two large armies will virtually guarantee a non-result, whereas a six will give both sides a good chance of a win. Swords kill simply on a roll of five or six, castles get to 'fight' in defence, and defending ships must be beaten first.<br/><br/>The game has an excellent basic structure.  The key to the game is the balance of military, political power, and wealth.  It really works well.  But, as always, there are improvements to be made and rules that can be changed to improve or change the flavor of the game.  But, the reason why the game works well is that there is an excellent structure underlying the few contested rules.<br/><br/>It's worth adding that a lot of the fun comes from the irreverent humour on the cards--just in case you thought you were playing a serious strategy game.  Names are satirical, silly, or obtuse references to real world people, places or events.  For example, there's a castle named &quot;Ratlarbig&quot; (look at it closely), a character called the &quot;Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; and a group of soldiers called &quot;The Bloody Buggers&quot;. It's a hoot whether you're winning or losing.<br/><br/>",1989,,,

2065,Basic Shogi Set,"['Grid Movement', 'Pattern Movement', 'Square Grid']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Of Japanese origins, Shogi is played on a 9 by 9 board, and the object is to capture the opponent's king. There are two main differences with Western chess. First, not only pawns but almost every piece can promote if it reaches the opponents three last rows. Second and most distinctive characteristic is that captured pieces become property of the capturing player and during his turn he can &quot;parachute&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; them back to the board instead of performing a normal move. Because of this feature, similar to Bughouse, the game can last longer than a Chess game, the board generally stays fairly crowded and there is no simplification going into the endgame. However, the endgame is typically more rapid with many possibilities for attack and ways to achieve a checkmate, which also makes draws/ties very rare.<br/><br/>According to &quot;A World of Chess&quot; by Jean-Louis Cazaux &amp; Rick Knowlton (2017, ISBN 978-0-7864-9427-9), Bishop, Rook and Drunk Elephant were introduced to the 9x9 Shogi creating Sho Shogi, the immediate predecessor of Shogi, in the middle of the 15th century. Modern Shogi where created with the introduction of the drop rule and the removal of the Drunk Elephant piece in Sho Shogi. This happened between 1567 and 1587 (earliest recording of modern Shogi). The latter date is based upon a picture in the diary of the samurai Matsudaira Ietada, dated 1587, which shows a game identical to the one of today.<br/><br/>",1587,,,

It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).<br/><br/>The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.<br/><br/><br/>     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)<br/><br/><br/>The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.<br/><br/>Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.<br/><br/>For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.<br/><br/>The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail. Includes 520 counters.<br/><br/>",1983,,,

If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.  Jumping moves must be taken when possible, thereby creating a strategy game where players offer up jumps in exchange for setting up the board so that they jump even more pieces on their turn.  A player wins by removing all of his opponent's pieces from the board or by blocking the opponent so that he has no more moves.<br/>This game, also known as Draughts, is part of the Checkers family.<br/><br/>The Official Checker Board to be used in tournaments and official matches of associations like international WCDF, ACF, and APCA usually shall be colored of green and off-white (buff).

Also, pieces are not captured - probably because this would mean revealing their identity - but simply jumped back 7 spaces on the track and if that space is occupied, they're jumped back another 7, and so on. It is possible to make any one piece's identity public for a moment though, by rolling a 6, but that 6 cannot then be used for movement also.<br/><br/>Like Sagaland/Enchanted Forest - which the playing pieces will bring to memory - this is more of a family game than simply a children's game.<br/><br/>",1988,,,

The mine was so prosperous, in fact, that the troll had accumulated enough wealth to retire after years of hard work.<br/>Once a year, the elves who live in the forests near the mine celebrate their Great Wood Fair. One of the highlights of each Fair is the mining competition. The troll, who enjoys the Fair just as much as the elves, gladly opens up the mine to let the elves dig for gold. Only the fastest and luckiest elf is allowed to keep his gold though, so while the competition is friendly, it is also very challenging. No one seems to care that the elves try to hinder each other by hiding stones where they think their fellow competitors will dig. In the end, it is the most clever elf who will win and stake a claim to his gold.<br/><br/>This is an simple bluffing game from the White Wind stable. Players spend money to buy shovels &amp; pickaxes to dig for gold. They then enter the mine, and start to dig. But wait!! players also get to place broken shovel and decoy counters on the board as well. A broken shovel means no gold, and you lose the implement you were digging with. All decoys (or no counters) means you get the gold value on the board space you're digging from.

It is a popular gambling game, but wagering real stakes is by no means necessary to have fun playing.<br/><br/>The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9 (Dots, Numbers or Characters, and Bamboo, the &quot;Ace&quot; of which almost always looks like a bird), three different dragons (Red, Green, and White [white is unusual in that it may look like a silvery dragon, or like a picture frame, or blank - think &quot;White dragon in a snowstorm&quot;), and the four winds (east, south, west, and north).  There are four copies of each tile.  This totals to 136 tiles. In addition, special Flower, Season, and Joker (American version) tiles may also be used.<br/><br/>Four players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit, which can only be drawn from the player at one's left, by calling &quot;Chow&quot;), triplets and quadruplets (which can be drawn from the discards out-of-turn by calling &quot;Pung&quot;), pairs, and other patterns. &quot;Pung&quot; takes precedence over &quot;Chow&quot;, and &quot;Mah Jongg&quot; takes precedence over all (and is the only situation one may draw &quot;Chow&quot; out-of-turn.) What happens if a single discard would give two (or more!) players &quot;Mah Jongg&quot;? Precedence goes to the player who would play next in normal sequence.<br/><br/>Originating in China in the mid-19th century, it was introduced to the U.S. in the 1920s.  It is now played in different forms throughout Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand.  Although the rules for game play are fairly constant, there are an immense variety of scoring schemes.

In turn, players roll a colored die, then offer at least one face-down money card to the player indicated by the roll. That player may either accept the offer or challenge it. After challenging the offer, the player rolls a numbered die. If the number is greater than the amount of money offered, the offering player must add at least one face-down card to the mix and begin the process anew. If the die roll is equal to the money, the offer must be accepted.

However, instead of staying in London, in this version players use H. G. Wells' Time Machine to travel to the future, attempting to solve infamous cases from the 20th Century.<br/><br/>Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction. The game includes 20 cases based on famous crimes and criminals of the 20th Century, including the Zodiac Killer, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime.<br/><br/>The board represents the various cities the crimes occurred in, with eighteen generic locations to find clues (Pharmacy, Hotel, Airport, Supermarket, Tavern, Harbor, FBI, etc.). Players must collect clues from different locations, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card. Movement is via die roll.<br/><br/>Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something important almost anywhere in town. The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to the Time Machine and announce the solution, is the winner.<br/><br/>There are two versions of this edition: Standard and Deluxe.

2121,The Sword and the Stars,"['Action Points', 'Voting']","['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Political', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']","Sword and the Stars sets the stage for interstellar conflict between vying empires on such a scale (the map depicts about 1/4 of a spiral galaxy) that individual ships and even fleets become insignificant. You pay for and resolve entire interstellar campaigns with cards representing massive scale investment of manpower and resources over 4 Earth years of operations, each player round representing the passage of 20 years. Players direct the fate of interstellar empires through expansion or consolidation by means of conquests, raids, governing, building planetary defenses, commerce, and diplomacy.<br/><br/>The game was derived from two existing popular SPI titles. While adding many subtle changes in its own right, it combines the highly successful system used in Empires of the Middle Ages with the graphic layout used for Freedom in the Galaxy. Technology and economics are abstracted, but both play a large role in just about every aspect of the game. Stargates allow players to conduct interstellar operations against any star system, free of range constraints. This means that in an interstellar war, nowhere is safe from your enemies.<br/><br/>Includes a mechanism for a sort of Galactic Security Council, where players can scheme all sorts of mischief against each other.<br/><br/>Ten scenarios (including the &quot;Galactic Cycle&quot; campaign game) are supplied. A &quot;short&quot; game will depict a period lasting about 200 years, while for the long &quot;grand campaign&quot; scenario it is recommended to play &quot;at least&quot; 1000 years. The Sword and the Stars is more compact than Empires. Includes 400 counters, 56 year cards, a 17 x 22&quot; map depicting a total of 42 star systems. Maximum 5 players (3-4 recommended).<br/><br/>Historical Note:<br/>Writing about SPI's Empires of the Middle Ages (q.v.), editor Kula included a sidebar quote from Redmond Simonsen to the effect that &quot;a good number of people...would really enjoy the game if they'd just imagine that it's a science fictional or fantastic continent instead of Europe&quot;. Well, in 1981, the year after Empires of the Middle Ages was released, SPI produced another game using the same system and the missing science fiction premise, and The Sword and the Stars was born.<br/><br/>",1981,,,
2122,Jyhad,"['Acting', 'Deck Construction', 'Hand Management', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Negotiation', 'Player Elimination', 'Voting']","['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Political']","Vampire: the Eternal Struggle (or VTES for short) is a multi-player collectable card game based on the award-winning Vampire: the Masquerade role playing game in which players take on the role of ancient vampires known as a Methuselahs. Considered mere legend by many, Methuselahs rule everything from the shadows, engaging in a eons-long Machiavellian conflict that encompasses political, social, and even physical warfare. The struggle is won or lost based on the actions taken by your minions &ndash; younger vampires who unknowingly do your bidding. In this way, the game can allow for deep and immersive storytelling as your minions purchase equipment, hire retainers, even suggest legislative changes to vampiric society, all in the service of your dark plots.<br/><br/>VTES was the second card game designed by Richard Garfield (designer of Magic the Gathering, Netrunner, and other games). It was designed to avoid some of the flaws that Garfield found in Magic: VTES does not require you to include resource or mana cards in your deck, and cards are instantly replaced when played, meaning that card draw isn&rsquo;t as important as knowing when to discard a card to sculpt a better hand. It also has a gameplay experience more in keeping with a boardgame than a traditional card game &ndash; VTES is usually played by 4 or 5 players and games can last up to 2 hours.<br/><br/>Unlike most multi-player games, players in VTES do not engage in a free-for-all. Each player directs their attacks to the player on their left (their &ldquo;prey&rdquo;) and defends against the player on their right (their &ldquo;predator&rdquo;). You gain victory points by eliminating or &ldquo;ousting&rdquo; your prey from the game, in which case the next player to the left becomes your new prey. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins (even if they have been ousted!). This arrangement makes the game a very social one &ndash; you and the player two seats to the left and right have common enemies. But if you help these allies too much, you may find that you&rsquo;ve made one of them too strong, and when they suddenly become your new predator, your help has transformed that ally into a deadly threat.<br/><br/>VTES is also a resource management game. Each player begins with 30 points of influence called &ldquo;pool&rdquo; that Methuselahs hold dearer than unlife itself. If you run out of pool, you are ousted from the game. But this pool is also the way that you sway vampires to your cause. Each turn you have the opportunity to spend your pool to seduce a vampire. Weak fledgling vampire are easily swayed, but the older more powerful ones require convincing, which may require multiple turns to accomplish. Once a vampire is converted to your side, all the pool you spent on them becomes blood possessed by this vampire, which can be spent to play cards that allow them to activate their unique vampiric powers. Each minion must manage their blood and you must manage your pool &ndash; spending more provides you with additional minions, but brings you one step closer to being ousted. Under- or over- investing in your minions may well cost you the game.<br/><br/>Vampire: The Eternal Struggle has risen once again from torpor!

Some of these can  support the group through computers while staying safe at home.  These cards have symbols on them that represent their abilities and these are use to bypass threats without actually having to face them.<br/>    Objectives - These are what you are making runs on.  They are worth reputation points and usually have a task that you must best or a number of symbols that you have to match with the symbols on your runners.<br/>    Challenge - You assign these to the objectives as additional hurdles that you have to get by before you can tackle the objective.  Usually you can overcome them with the right symbols but if not they can represent nasty things you will have to fight or things that will just hurt you.<br/>    Gear - This is stuff that you assign to runners to help them make runs.  Some gear requires you to have a runner with a matching symbol.<br/>    Locations - These represent places that you control and can help you in various ways.<br/>    Contacts - These represent people that will help you. <br/>    Specials - These are instants that you play to affect the current situation.<br/><br/><br/>Everything is driven by money which is hard to come by.

Other similarities include an extra turn when doubles are rolled, two decks of cards (&quot;Production&quot; and &quot;Exploration&quot;), income tax, income upon passing the start space and even incorporation of the unofficial &quot;Free Parking&quot; variant, here called the Slush Fund.<br/><br/>Different is an interior board path and an elevated 6x6 drilling board. Landing on an outer board space usually offers the chance to lease a plot on the drilling board if not already leased. Travel on the interior board, possible only by landing exactly on its entrance or possession of a plastic permit token (obtained by landing on other spaces), permits drilling once one has a drilling company. This is very much a costly hit-and-miss affair, especially when drilling without any other proven oil fields nearby.<br/><br/>If the player does not go bankrupt, eventually his plots should be populated with a lot of black plastic pegs indicating gushers rather than the yellow ones which signify dry holes. Then each time a player passes the start, he is paid based on the number of barrels he is pumping.<br/><br/>Unlike Monopoly, the idea is not to drive others into bankruptcy, but to be the first to reach one million dollars.

On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.

At the beginning of each hand, each player makes a wager of some of their 7 mission cards based on how confident they are that they can &quot;win&quot; the hand by causing the most damage. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand or cards set aside from previous hands. Cards include Power cards (basic attack or defense in a skill type), Universe cards (e.g., a city bus, which adds value to a Strength attack), Special cards (usually character specific with varying effects), and more in later expansions. At the end of each hand, the damage from that hand is totaled; the player who caused the most &quot;completes&quot; their wagered missions, while the other player is &quot;defeated&quot; with those missions. Players may concede a hand instead of playing a card, losing their missions but avoiding further damage<br/><br/>A player wins when they have knocked out all 4 opposing characters, &quot;completed&quot; all of their missions, or their opponent is &quot;defeated&quot; in all missions.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>This is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.<br/><br/>First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing &quot;destiny&quot;) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 &quot;counters&quot; worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also &quot;effect&quot; cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.<br/><br/>Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of &quot;battle card, weapon card, character card.&quot;  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of &quot;power dots&quot; (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the &quot;die&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.<br/><br/>The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.<br/><br/>If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also &quot;surrender&quot; the planet.<br/><br/>You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.

2132,Guardians,['Secret Unit Deployment'],"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']","This CCG plays more like a board game than a card game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a Guardian, a very powerful creature with special abilities.  In front of the Guardian you place a set of 3 stronghold cards.  These are locations that give you bonuses.  In front of these are 3 empty spaces that terrain cards will be placed.  These will match up to the other players 3 empty spaces thus creating the board.<br/><br/>Onto your stronghold you can place creatures under a shield to keep them hidden.  Only creatures under a shield can move and they can move up to 2 spaces with some restrictions.  There is a limit to what can be put under the shields so you can not make your army too big.<br/><br/>When two armies met they battle.  Combat is fairly detailed.  Both players pick up their cards from under the shields to make a combat hand.  Each player secretly chooses one creature and they are placed down on the table.  The stronger then covers the weaker.  This is repeated for each creature until only one player has creatures left in his hand.  He can then assign these creatures to help any of the previous creatures placed.  There are many modifiers involved and each stack of creatures must be checked for a winner.  All losers are discarded.  After determining each battle the total strength of each army is checked.  The weaker army must then retreat or the attacker in case of a tie.<br/><br/>To win you must either control all six of the lands between the strongholds, destroy 5 of the opponents shields or destroy the opposing Guardian.<br/><br/>After the first release, a revised edition was published ('Guardians Revised Edition').

This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.<br/><br/>Play begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:<br/>Redraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards<br/>Regeneration - heal characters that have been hurt<br/>Resource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.<br/>Umbra - play special umbra cards and actions<br/>Moot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.<br/>Combat - resolve any fights.<br/><br/>Each round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:<br/>1) Attack another Alpha<br/>2) Attack a victim<br/>3) Attack an enemy<br/>4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character<br/>5) Attack a territory<br/>6) Do nothing.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.<br/><br/>Renown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies. Some packs may reverse the rules and gain victory by defeating victims.  Renown can also be earned from moots and quests.<br/><br/>",1995,,,

The card types are:<br/><br/>Characters - These are your soldiers and they are laid out in a grid that is a maximum of three deep.  You can only attack or defend with the first untapped character in each row (with exceptions of course).  Some characters also generate Pull points.  These are used like money to bring cards in play or to generate influence which is needed to win so they of course must be protected.<br/><br/>Resources - These generate Pull for bringing cards into play.  Pull generated from resources can not be used to generate influence.<br/><br/>Whammy - These are instants that you can play anytime.<br/><br/>Gear - These are items you can assign to characters.<br/><br/>Condition - These are assigned to characters and can have positive or negative affects.<br/><br/>Environmental - These cards affect the game as a whole.<br/><br/>Secrets - These usually affect cards from specific conspiracies.<br/><br/>The game is generally played by putting your big hitters in your front row, your big defenders in your second row and your pull generators in your last row.  First player to generate a predetermined amount of influence wins.<br/><br/>The art on the cards is very strange and different people either love or despise.<br/><br/>",1994,,,

The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.<br/><br/>Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.<br/><br/>History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn<br/>MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four<br/>PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours<br/><br/>",1995,,,

Although usually played by two players, theoretically any number of players can participate at once.<br/><br/>Players can choose one of a number of factions from within the Warhammer 40,000 universe - examples include, humanity's defenders, the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, the nearly extinct race of Eldar, the all-consuming Tyranids or the corrupted once-human forces of Chaos. Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.<br/><br/>Players select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.<br/><br/>Games usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.<br/><br/>Expansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.<br/><br/>",1998,,,
2163,Space Hulk,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board']","['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']","Space Hulk is a light miniatures wargame set in the Warhammer 40K universe.  It has a relatively simple rule-set (compared to Warhammer 40K itself) and is known for its fast play and immersive theme (think the movie Aliens).<br/><br/>You lay out corridors and rooms that represent a space hulk, a large disabled ship floating in space. The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.<br/><br/>Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.<br/><br/>The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.<br/><br/>The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.<br/><br/>The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions. There are also rules for psychic powers.<br/><br/>There was also the Space Hulk Campaign Book  that can be linked for longer games. This book also added rules for traitor Marines and new weapons.<br/><br/>Even with all rules in place the game does not get too complicated and is a very good introduction to Warhammer 40K.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/>Space Hulk (2nd Edition)<br/>Space Hulk (3rd Edition)<br/>Space Hulk (4th Edition)<br/><br/>",1989,,,

Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering.<br/><br/>Many people who buy the product often do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.<br/><br/>Each player plays the role of a Pok&eacute;mon trainer that use their Pok&eacute;mon creatures to battle the Pok&eacute;mon creatures of the other Pok&eacute;mon trainer.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, and be the first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that include your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players, or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.<br/><br/>You start the game by drawing seven cards to your hand.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prize cards.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.<br/><br/>Players take alternating turns during which they can:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card from their deck to their hand<br/>     Play Actions:<br/>         Put Basic Pok&eacute;mon in play from their hand to their Bench<br/>         Evolve their Pok&eacute;mon<br/>         Attach an Energy card to one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)<br/>         Play Trainer cards (Only 1 Stadium card and 1 Supporter card per turn)<br/>         Retreat their Active Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn - trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards))<br/>         Use Abilities<br/>    <br/>     Attack<br/><br/><br/>In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.<br/><br/>The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.<br/><br/>There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

2172,Stealth Chess,"['Deduction', 'Grid Movement', 'Memory', 'Square Grid']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Stealth Chess is a chess-under-imperfect-information variant, a kind of cross between chess and Stratego. In name and power, the pieces are standard chessmen, but they are shaped like Stratego pieces so that each player can only identify the pieces of his own army. At the start both sides arrange their armies any way they like on the first two ranks. Pawns are allowed to move two squares forward on either the first or second rank. The object is to capture the enemy King. The identity of a piece is revealed when it is captured. The official rules then call for the piece to be returned to its previous owner (off the board), facing away from its captor.<br/><br/>Stealth Chess has the same pieces as conventional chess(16 Black &amp; 16 White) but unlike traditional chess, all pieces look the same and have the pieces title printed on the back side so your only chance to win is to memorize the movement of your opponents and which piece was moved. This memory play helps with regular chess play by improving your memory.<br/><br/>The game begins with pieces being randomly placed by each player in the first and second row of each side of the board. You decide the strategic possibilities of the placement of your pieces. For example, you might put your Queen front-row center and hide your King in a corner. The excitement begins with the first move. From that point forward, you must try to figure out your opponent's pieces by their movements and seek out and capture the King. Of course, you may &quot;disguise&quot; a powerful piece by moving it as if it were a mere Pawn--until you strike without warning. No check, no checkmate. Boom! Victory is yours.<br/><br/>There are several different rule sets included that the players agree upon beforehand. The simplest is a standard opening position setup.

2173,4 Player Chess,"['Grid Movement', 'Player Elimination', 'Square Grid', 'Static Capture']","['Abstract Strategy', ""Children's Game""]","Four-Player Chess (Four-handed chess, Chess-4, and 4-Chess) is often credited to Capt Charles Verney, who was the first known to have documented the game in England in 1881.  Four-player versions of chess probably have existed for hundreds of years prior to Verney in one form or another.  Verney's four-player board consists of three rows added to each side of a standard 2-player board, and four complete sets of chessmen in four different colors.  Modern four-player boards and colored pieces are available from several manufacturers.<br/><br/>In Verney's version (1881), 4 player chess was a partnership game, and the object was to checkmate both opposing partners at the same time.  In modern variants, four player games can range from partners, to cutthroat (every player for himself), to temporary alliances at will.<br/><br/>Starting configuration affects fairness (bias).  The standard 2-player configuration of queen facing queen is biased in four player chess because there is only one axis of symmetry.  Four player chess requires two axes of symmetry to be fair (unbiased).  To avoid bias, Verney recommended a staring configuration of all queens on light (or all on dark) squares.  Another unbiased starting configuration is all queens on the right (or all on the left) of the king.<br/><br/>For the most part, four player chess follows (or can follow) all the normal rules of two-player chess.  Verney had special rules for partnership playing, disallowed castling, and pawns had to make it to the enemies last rank in order to be exchanged for another piece.  Pawns could also march up and back down the board.  Verney also had checkmate as the ultimate move.<br/><br/>In modern variations of four-player chess, partnering may not be required, but allowable, castling can be allowed, and actual capturing of a king a required move to eliminate a player.  The Chess Federation does not recognize four-player chess in any form, and there are no official rules, so players are free to experiment with variations and make their own rules.<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>        Bughouse Chess<br/>        Vendetta<br/><br/><br/>",1881,,,

The first part of the game is the auction, by which partners attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding, in order to arrive at a successful contract. The contract specifies how many tricks must be taken by the team that wins the bid. After the auction, a member of the team that won the bid tries to win as many tricks as possible while playing both hands from the partnership. One hand is played normally while the other (the &quot;dummy hand&quot;) is placed face-up on the table, allowing for greater control. The defenders attempt to take enough tricks to make the contract fail.<br/><br/>The formal name of the game is Contract Bridge, but the shortened name &quot;Bridge&quot; is the most common usage. Bridge developed from the 17th Century card game Whist. The earliest form of Bridge originated in 1886 when rules were introduced allowing the dealer to choose a trump and their partner's hand to become dummy. Bridge became Auction Bridge in 1904, which allowed the trump suit to be decided by the highest bidding partnership. Harold Vanderbilt transformed Auction Bridge into Contract Bridge in 1925, when he introduced an improved method of scoring.<br/><br/>The duplicate version of the game has many pairs of partners, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This method removes the element of luck in getting good cards when comparing players and thus helps to isolate the role of skill in the game.<br/><br/>",1925,,,

2190,Star Trek: The Card Game,[],"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Science Fiction']","This CCG is based on the original series. Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.<br/><br/>The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.<br/><br/>The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.<br/><br/>You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.<br/><br/>XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.<br/><br/>The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy.

2201,Redemption,"['Deck Construction', 'Hand Management']","['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Religious']","Redemption(&trade;) is a Bible-based collectible card game (CCG). Created in 1995 by Rob Anderson of Cactus Game Design Inc. as a Christian faith alternative to Magic the Gathering, Redemption (&trade;) is the 2nd-longest running CCG in existence (after Magic). As of 2023, 6 starter sets and 24 expansion sets have been released, along with many promotional cards. There are over 4500 unique Redemption cards in print - including variants and reprints.<br/><br/>For all of the impressive numbers, what is even more impressive is that every single Redemption card is based on a character, event, or concept from the Bible and has its own identifying Bible verse(s). Moreover, most cards&rsquo; special abilities tie directly into their verse&rsquo;s meaning or topic.<br/><br/>Going further - the game is a simple-to-learn, complex-to-master strategy game. Unlike most other CCGs, it is 2-sided: each player plays offense and defense, and will build each into their customized deck.<br/><br/>So how do you play? In a nutshell, the first player to rescue 5 lost souls (in &ldquo;Type 1&rdquo; format, or 7 Lost Souls in Type 2 format) is the winner. Lost Souls are rescued by using Heroes on offense, and strategically overcoming your opponent&rsquo;s defensive villains, called Evil Characters. Each time you do that, you rescue 1 Lost Soul card, and the turn is passed for your opponent to play offense with their Heroes and against your defensive Evil Characters. Hundreds of unique special abilities create endless play combinations and deep strategy, for extremely high replay value for the game. Once you get into Redemption, you&rsquo;ll always enjoy tweaking - or completely scrapping and starting over - decks, acquiring new cards, trying new strategies, and testing yourself against opponents in casual and tournament settings.<br/><br/>Speaking of tournaments, every year there is a long tournament season, filled with local, district, state, and regional tournaments, as well as a national tournament, that anyone can attend. The national tournament, known within the community as &quot;Nationals&quot;, is usually hosted in the summer months of July or August. This event is a 3 day tournament where every legal category is played to determine a National Champion of that category for the year. Also, at this point, the annual ranking system for players which awards points for top 3 finishes in sanctioned tournaments throughout the year is finalized and the winners are announced. All National winners and winners of a category in the annual ranking system for a category receive special National Winner Promos. These are some of the coolest looking cards in the game and are highly sought after as playable collectibles.<br/><br/>Though of course far from perfect, being a Christian game in which most players who play are Christians, there is also a wonderful community that has been established over the past 25 years. So many players are welcoming and encouraging to newcomers and veterans alike, and there is an online message board and Discord channel in which conversation goes on daily. This is a community in which players feel just as natural about asking a strategy question about the game as sharing a personal prayer topic - trusting that they will be treated with respect and care no matter what. This active community of Redemption players, which includes the team of Elders (the game's leadership group), have really worked hard to make it about as easy to join the game as can be. There are tremendous community driven resources to provide plenty of engagement with new and active players alike. In addition to the message boards and Discord, the game has an active subreddit, a blog site with contributions from the broad community of players, active Youtubers and even two podcasts - One a weekly source of content spanning various topics of the game and the other a biweekly dive into high level competitive gameplay.<br/><br/>",1995,,,

To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.<br/><br/>When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over.

This is played in teams, the human team trying to get 3 humans off the board via the chopper, and the dinosaur team trying to prevent this. When 3 play, the third player alternates teams.<br/><br/>The humans can jump between building roofs or can run between them. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs move a lot faster on the ground than the humans (the humans move between marked spaces, the dinosaurs between zones). Buildings have several entry/exit points for the humans but only one for the raptors. Dice indicate how to move humans and dinosaurs; one of the dice has Stop/Go markings which control whether you may roll again or not --making movement harder to predict. Jumping (for humans) and entering buildings (for dinosaurs) is also dice controlled. The T-Rex is confined to a single board edge area; its function is to flush the humans from the starting building -- once he reaches it, all remaining humans are devoured!<br/><br/>Yes, unlike the first movie game, in this one there is death aplenty. As soon as a dinosaur enters a space with humans in it, even when just passing through, they're all eaten.

In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.<br/><br/>The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.

With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.<br/><br/>The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control.

Real townspeople are &quot;swapped out&quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars.

2230,Ayanu,[],['Abstract Strategy'],"This game is 'Chess-like' in many ways: two players have identical sets of game pieces starting on opposite sides of a square grid. Players move one piece per turn and can eliminate the other player's pieces by moving into their space. Movement options depend on which piece it is you're moving. In a fit of conspicuous difference, it's the black side who makes the opening move here.<br/><br/>The central gimmick is that each piece is composed of two parts, a body and a head. The height of the body determines how far a piece can move (one, two or three spaces), whereas the head determines the directions: straight lines (like rooks), diagonals (like bishops), or both (like kings or queens). Each side also has one super-powered queen/rook hybrid which can move to any space within the range determined by its body, and even one unbeatable but immobile head.<br/><br/>There's a reason for all this separation into bodies and heads: after every move the piece which just moved must swap heads with a different type of head, chosen by the player from their pieces still in play.<br/><br/>There are two victory conditions: either you move one of your pieces to a specific target square on the far side of the board, or you force your opponent to make an illegal move. Draws are possible, but rare (they require both sides' forces to be extremely depleted).<br/><br/>The theme is pretty much irrelevant - this is an abstract at heart. The rulebook frames the game as the secret strategy-honing tool of the nobles in a fictional culture, and the rules introduction is presented in dialogue form with the Wise Old Master teaching the game to his Young Noble Student, but none of this is at all relevant to gameplay. In fact, the game presented within the fiction is themeless and, quite literally, abstract: the pieces' names are translated as abstract concepts like 'strength' etc.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

It employs a scale of 300 meters per hex, with daily turns and 2160 counters.<br/><br/>The two designers spent years researching the orders of battle and aerial maps to produce a game that is possibly the most researched and arguably the most accurate depiction of a battle, mechanics aside.<br/><br/>The large, fairly thin but sturdy counters are the shades of the uniforms of the armies according to the designers. Instead of the usual American style designations on the counters to depict what type of unit it is, the designers used the actual designations used by the separate armies. This could be confusing except for the wonderful large player aids supplied with actual photos of the unit types. Labels and ziplock bag are even supplied for sorting purposes although sorting can be confusing. Moves mag put out an issue in the late '70's, early '80's with an article that fixed the problem.<br/><br/>The 3 large maps are taken straight from aerial photos. You see the city block by block and outside the city individual buildings can even be seen. There is very little color on the maps but they are beautiful and very functional. The terrain effects chart once again has actual photos of the terrain so you can get an idea of exactly what the soldiers were facing.<br/><br/>There are many scenarios available so you can tailor the game for time and room as some only use 1 map or a portion of a map. Each scenario has a separate set up sheet for both sides that are large enough to put all the counters on the sheets. Each scenario has a miniature version of the map to be used with set up information. For a monster game it is very easy to set up and get into a game.<br/><br/>There are 3 rulebooks included, 2 basic game and 1 advanced game. When learning the game it is fantastic that they included a rulebook for each player. This is the kind of detail that is evident throughout the game. The rule books are detailed without being overbearing, as a lot of Avalon Hill's and SPI's were from the time period. They are chock full of examples to clear up ambiguities.<br/><br/>The game is difficult because of the scale only. It is actually a fairly simple game, mechanics wise, and can be played by anyone with some wargame experience. This game shows that it has been designed to play, by wargamers, in every detail.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.<br/><br/>As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.<br/><br/>The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &quot;protective&quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits.

You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt!

In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).<br/><br/>For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.<br/><br/>During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race.

2309,L'Arche de Noé,"['Modular Board', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Set Collection']",['Nautical'],"This game is a distant relative of &quot;Survive!&quot; which introduces a number of interesting twists.<br/><br/>You are Noah's helpers and are competing to bring the best variety of animals on board before the waters rise too much.  The board and bits are very nice plastic, except for the animals which are cardboard (and whose bases tend to fray after a while).  There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.<br/><br/>The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.<br/><br/>You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &quot;expedition&quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &quot;berth&quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.<br/><br/>Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.<br/><br/>As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.<br/><br/>The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.<br/><br/>",1986,,,

The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.<br/><br/>Interestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.<br/><br/>The game is asymmetrical; each zoo has its own strengths and weaknesses and favour different strategies.<br/><br/>Note that there are several different versions of the game with varying mechanics, some of which have much more strategy than others; see the community wiki for details.<br/><br/>",1964,,,

The Travel-Cards indicate journeys to be made by the Travelers, and the distance to be traveled in each move is determined by spinning.  As the routes of travel are well-known railroad and steamship lines, the players acquire a knowledge of these, also the chief cities and ports and their principal articles of commerce...&quot;<br/><br/>The game was first published by Milton Bradley in 1911.

Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.<br/><br/>The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.<br/><br/>Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.<br/><br/>The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.<br/><br/>Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown.

The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.<br/><br/>The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon.

Each card shows a monetary value, along with a number of shares. Reveal cards from the deck until you get one card of each color, and use these cards to set the starting price of the shares for each of the four corporations. Deal each player a hand of eight cards, and give each player $20,000 as starting capital.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can deal in shares (both buying and selling) and change the value of stocks, but you must do all of your dealing either prior to or subsequent to changing stock values. When you deal, you can sell any number of shares you own, earning money from the bank equal to the number of shares sold by the current value of those shares; when you buy, you can lay down at most two cards from your hand, paying money to the bank equal to the number of shares bought by the current value of those shares.<br/><br/>When you change value, you take one or two cards from your hand and cover a corporation's current value with this new value; corporations have different limits on how much they can be raised or lowered per card play, with some being more stable than others. If you play the highest-valued cards, you can either pump up the value tremendously &mdash; or tank the stock, bringing its value to $0, with all players discarding all shares they own of this stock. (A player can jumpstart the value of this company by playing a new stock value on it, even with the second card played on the same turn.)<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can skip the dealing and changing actions to discard 1-4 cards from hand. In either case, to end your turn, replenish your hand to eight cards.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, take all of the discards and all of the stock value cards other than the top one of each corporation and shuffle them together with a &quot;Market Closed&quot; card to form a new deck. Continue play until the &quot;Market Closed&quot; card is drawn, at which point the game ends immediately, and all shares held by players are cashed out at the current stock value.

Second, no row can consist of more than five numbers. Finally, if a player places all five of their tiles in a single turn, they must be able to score in at least two directions.

2396,Ur 1830 BC,"['Auction/Bidding', 'Tile Placement']","['Ancient', 'Civilization']","This game isn't a true 18xx game, in the sense that it's officially sanctioned by Francis Tresham.  However, it shares a good number of characteristics with the 18xx series of games, while still being different enough to be a different game.  The game is about diverting water from rivers into irrigation channels and supplying the life-giving water to sections of land.  In 18xx, there are private companies; in Ur, there are independent nations.  In 18xx, there are companies with shareholders and a majority-controlling president; in Ur, there are countries with landowners and a majority-controlling King.  Once a Kingdom has enough land purchased in it, it begins to build water infrastructure in the form of reservoirs and pumps.  These structures draw the water away from the rivers into irrigation channels which are drawn straight on the board.  Like 18xx, the technology increases as the game progresses, making channel diggers obsolete and bringing out more efficient waterworks.  When a section of land is irrigated, the owner earns a small degree income and the kingdom it's located in earns a much larger income, which can then be given to the landowners or kept in the Kingdom's coffers for future upgrades.  The game is finally over when all the incoming water is used, forcing the southern tribes to invade, or a kingdom cannot fulfill it's obligation to buy more ditch-diggers and falls into revolution.  The player with the largest personal holdings (land and money) is the victor.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.<br/><br/>Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.<br/><br/>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.<br/><br/>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).<br/><br/>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.<br/><br/>",1630,,,
2398,29 Cribbage Board,['Hand Management'],['Card Game'],"Cribbage is a card game invented in the early 17th century, based on the earlier game Noddy. It is played with a deck of standard playing cards and a signature piece of equipment called the cribbage board.  Cribbage is traditionally played as a 2 player game.<br/><br/>In the version usually played today, each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, from which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.<br/><br/>Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.  The winner is the first to reach 121 points.<br/><br/>The origin date listed for this game is approximate.<br/><br/>",1630,,,

Each player has 5 pawns which travel around a 3 by 10 board in an S shaped path.  Movement is dictated by the throw of 4 sticks (black on one side and white on the other) which can produce a 1,2,3,4, or 6, (5 is not possible) depending on how they land..  As in backgammon, the objective is to bear all of one's pawns off first.  A couple of interesting differences is that there are safe and trap spaces on the board.  Also, players may block each others' progress as in Parchisi.  Senet sets are usually constructed from various woods and are often quite beautiful.  Senet is one of the oldest boardgames but unfortunately it fell out of use for a few thousand years and no ancient rules set has been discovered.  Undoubtably another tragic loss resulting from the Library of Alexandria burning to the ground.  As a result scholars has made several educated guesses as to the rules.

Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).<br/><br/>A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).<br/><br/>Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.<br/><br/>The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.<br/><br/>The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.<br/><br/>",1975,,,
2428,American Heritage Game of the Civil War,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Square Grid']","['American Civil War', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']","One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.<br/><br/>This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).<br/><br/>Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.<br/><br/>You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.<br/><br/>A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.<br/><br/>",1961,,,

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.<br/><br/>The Barons of Fyn is a card based strategy game in which competing players each try to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn.<br/><br/>The Great King Timothy has decided he will leave his kingdom, Fyn, and fight in the great crusades.  While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.<br/><br/>The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.  The standard game is played until King Timothy returns to Fyn, at which point, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn?<br/><br/>The game features a dynamic board that is generated as the players lay land cards; however, instead of a Kings-and-Things style board, this one combines some features of Illuminati, in the sense that each player's layout is independent of the others', except that when a group of cards is captured, the entire group is slid to your layout for hook-up, possibly discarding cards that can't fit (that would cause an overlap).<br/><br/>",1994,,,

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.<br/><br/>LNL - Laplace, Newton &amp; Lagrange (briefly known as DeltaVee in its early stages) is a game of ship to ship combat in outer space.  Using a unique movement system that forces players to deal with momentum, and a fast and simple combat system, LNL is a great addition to the space game genre.<br/><br/>The game involves combat between the Moon and Earth, with individual ships represented by each counter.  Each side has from 3-8 ships.  Each ship has a log covering armament, fuel, engines and defence.  These logs are reminiscent or the Task Force Game 'Starfire', but have fewer options, but a more sophisticated layout.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is a vector-momentum system (like the one in Yaquinto's Shooting Stars or SPI's Vector Three).  Ships have a facing, use fuel to thrust towards the current facing, but speeds carry over from turn to turn.  Therefore ships can only decelerate only by turning and thrusting in the opposite direction of travel.  Speed is marked by placing numbered counters in the relevant direction.<br/><br/>Combat involves the use of missiles, guns (i.e. projectile weapons) and lasers.  Missiles are launched and move much like ships.  They are more manoeuvrable, but have a limited amount of fuel, used for acceleration and turning.  As a defence ships may have point defence weapons.  Guns and lasers are ranged weapons, with different arcs of fire, but essentially the same resolution.  Damage is assessed by throwing the requisite number of dice - any dice will do, or  even coins - the game using an EOR (even/odds randomiser) - with odd rolls yielding a hit.  Damage is then marked off the ship, with the affected area depending on the side through which fire was taken.<br/><br/>Each side (Moon and Earth) has a choice of 8 types of ships and 5 basic scenarios are available, each with a great deal of flexibility.  Tactics can be involved and subtle.  The  interplay of weapon types makes this an exciting game.  It is easy to learn and has great variety.<br/><br/>",1994,,,

The game scale is 500 meters per hex and about 5 minutes per turn.  Capital ships are modeled individually.  Complexity is medium.  Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.<br/><br/>This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.  However, thanks to the simplicity of the rules, it is an easy task to design these craft for your own games.<br/><br/>",1996,,,

If the aircraft get within dogfight distance of each other (4 hexes), they may engage in a dogfight, which uses cards (a better pilot rating gives you extra cards) --it also forces the torpedoes to be dropped, so sacrifice dogfights are a viable tactic.

2445,Chaseback,[],['Abstract Strategy'],"This is an unusual two-player strategy game.  The board consists of five columns, within each of which a &quot;man&quot; moves back and forth.  The men are moved by both players.  At the ends of each column are the players' goals (one end belongs to one player, the other end to his opponent).  Each player tries to reach his goals by exact count, scoring a point every time this is achieved.  First player to reach 15 points wins.<br/>   The spaces within the columns are numbered in seemingly random fashion, except for the centre row, which is all numbered 4.  The game starts with all men in the centre.  One player calls out a number from 1 to 5.  His opponent then moves a man that number of spaces in either direction (no back-and-forthing allowed).  The number on the space onto which the man lands gives the move for the next man --and this mechanism applies throughout the game, so the only random element is the initial call of 1 to 5.<br/>   Each player moves three different men, then his opponent does the same (the first man he moves cannot be the last one you moved), and so on.  Every time a man reaches a goal (by exact count), a point is scored and the man teleports back to the centre.  To complicate matters slightly, there are two &quot;safe spaces&quot; in each column, those on one side of the centre belonging to one player, those on the other to his opponent.  A player may not move more than two men onto safe spaces at once.  You cannot move a man from your opponent's safe spaces, so this is used to constrain the opponent's possible moves.<br/>   A software version of this would be very interesting, particularly if the board could be randomised...<br/><br/>",1962,,,

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top.

Then you play your sets (3 or 4 cards of same color and value) and runs (3 to 7 consecutive cards of the same color) or increase already played sets and runs. Finally, you must discard a card; special cards are truly discarded once their effects are resolved; the other cards are discarded to the playing area, slightly overlapping each other in sequence. When you pick up a card from the playing area, it must be used to play a run or set and you must pick up any cards that follow it (were discarded after it).<br/><br/>Going out scores a 5-point bonus and ends the round. All played sets and runs score (sets are worth 2 per card; runs are worth 1 per card); cards left in hand penalize you 1 point per card.<br/><br/>The number cards (84) come in 3 colors and run from 1 to 7 (there are four of each). Wild cards (6) can replace any number card but cannot be played to form their own sets or runs. Double cards (3) are used to double the value of all of your sets and runs of a given color. The Special cards (14) do various things such as reshuffling the draw and discard decks, stealing a set, run or double, giving a card away, etc. The Zero Zap card (1), if left in your hand when someone goes out, zaps your score for that round to zero (Yikes!).

On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.<br/><br/>Random events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.

It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.<br/>Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.<br/><br/>Will You Volunteer for this Dangerous Mission?<br/><br/>You and your opponent compete to be the first executive your perilous mission.

Engage in dogfights at close quarters to force your opponent to retreat. Penetrate enemy radar to challenge Zaxxon to a showdown!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: <br/>1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. <br/>2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. <br/>3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination<br/>4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN THE GAME: <br/>Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.<br/><br/>",1982,,,

You must also study in the great European cities to increase your alchemical knowledge. But beware! The Grand Inquisitor is hunting you, and other alchemist scheme against you. Be the first to discover the secret and transmute common metal into gold.<br/><br/>General Mechanics:<br/>You control an alchemist and two apprentices. They will move around a map of Europe to various cities and gather knowledge cards. Getting a certain number allows you to attempt a transmutation. Keep the location of your secret lab from the Grand Inquisitor and other players to avoid going to trial (jail) and losing knowledge cards. Event cards in the game allow you to search, protect yourself, move further, steal from other players, take shortcuts, increase your strength in a fight, etc. The final objective is to successfully complete enough transmutations to collect 5 bars of gold.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

The actual time period covered is 320 BC to 1220 AD.<br/><br/>In Hispania advanced rules, the players try to outbid each other in an auction for up to 30 different tribes and peoples. The auction system guarantees that each game is quite unlike the previous one.

Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits.

Throughout the game players capture each others' pieces as in normal chess, but can continually add to the board from the cards they hold in their hands.<br/><br/>Additional rules, such as the pawn combo (after moving a pawn, you can make a second move through or into the vacated space), add new elements over classic chess.  Pawn combos together with piece limits and placement restrictions serve to balance the value of the different pieces.

The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point.

There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.<br/><br/>Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.<br/><br/>The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form.

In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).  The most common action is for a player to place faction blocks on the board.  He shows he controls these blocks by placing one of his tokens on top of the stack.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into two sets, set 'A' and 'B'.  The 'A' deck is used first and tends to favor the moderates and Royalists.  Once this deck has been exhausted the 'B' deck comes into play, which tends to favor the radicals.<br/><br/>The election is triggered when all of one type of faction block has been exhausted.  The faction blocks will determine which faction forms the next government.  Players are attempting to score victory points by having the most influence in the government and opposition.  Points can also be picked up in later turns for being the general in charge at a victorious battle, and for winning elections in specific provinces.<br/><br/>Normally the player with the most victory points will win.  However, there are two sudden death game end conditions that may alter the outcome.  The first is a radical electoral landslide, triggered by the red faction gaining 17 or more votes.  The second is  successful Royalist counter-revolution, precipitated by Royalist control of seven counter-revolutionary provinces.  In both cases, victory is determined by a different set of criteria, in which accrued victory points do not count.  The player who is ahead on points must be aware that one mistake could lead to defeat at the hands of the Jacobins or Royalists!<br/><br/>It is likely that you will never have played a game quite like this one and you may find yourself wondering what strategies to employ.

Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.<br/><br/>The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.

As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either  squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.<br/><br/>Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified as Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines either who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.<br/><br/>Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that cast spell if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.<br/><br/>Next comes the Battle phase which is based on the previously determined initiative roll and players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement and making attacks before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have moved on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.<br/><br/>There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).<br/><br/>The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.<br/><br/>Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.<br/><br/>A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself.

It is played on a map which displays 74 star systems in a three-dimensional &quot;sphere&quot; of space measuring roughly 40 light years in diameter, with Earth's home system at the center. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement and position of pieces.  Pieces' exact locations are not known until they &quot;meet&quot; in the same three-dimensional &quot;hex space&quot;.<br/><br/>The pieces in the game represent groups of four interstellar spaceships (StarForces) and space stations (StarGates). Each Player maneuvers his pieces (via Stellar Shifting) to engage those of the enemy. Movement is plotted and executed simultaneously. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>Battles take place when units are in the same three-dimensional location.  In the Basic Game, the attacking Player compares the total variable strengths of the involved units and consults a simple probability table to determine the outcome of each battle.  In the Advanced Game, a small tactical maneuver map is used. When enemy forces engage on the main map, they are transferred to the tactical display. Here they move (in three dimensions), attack and defend using a fixed number of action points per tactical turn.<br/><br/>Combat outcomes result in pieces not being destroyed but being &quot;randomised&quot;; usually to a location far from all the action.<br/><br/><br/>Part of the StarForce Trilogy box set, along with Outreach and StarSoldier. There are also special rules to use Starsoldier as a tactical game for StarForce.<br/><br/>",1974,,,

(Copper Kettle, or since it's about witches, Copper Cauldron Co.) we imagine witches or wizards shopping for ingredients for their magic potions.  Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of cards (ingredients) and you pick one from the row or column where you stop.  The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.  You try to collect sets of four matching ingredients and get penalty points if you have only one of a particular ingredient.  The scoring rules can be made more complicated if the players desire, but for most the basic rules are satisfying.  A touch of memory is involved since you can see only the last ingredient you picked up on your stack of cards.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Create a 6x6 grid of ingredient cards (numbered 1-4, 14 ingredient types; 2 each in 5 colors, and the player colors black and white) minus the corners. Place the 2 player pawns on opposite corners. Each player gets a random card (not of their color) in front of them. For the advanced game, players also get 2 recipe cards = bonus points at end of game if you meet the conditions (e.g., at least 3 cards of both ingredients in a color; fewer 4s than the other player, etc.).<br/><br/>On your turn, move clockwise as many spaces around the grid as the number showing on your card stack, then take a card in that row and place on top of your stack (may never look through your stack) -- if land on corner, get nothing. Place the top card from the draw deck in the empty spot. If you drew a card with a magic hat/wand icon, take a second turn (max 2 consecutive turns). If you got a card with an exploding icon, the other player places their top card on the bottom of the draw deck (if deck empty, remove card from game instead).<br/><br/>The game ends when any row is empty. Then sort your cards by ingredient type and score according to number of each type:<br/>- 1 = negative points<br/>- 2 = 0<br/>- 3 = sum<br/>- 4 = sum + 5 (i.e., 15 VP)<br/>- then, if in your own color, double the value<br/>- score any bonus points from end-game recipes.<br/>Most points wins!<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Each turn, a number of terrain cards equal to the number of players in the game are auctioned off and placed before the appropriate player's train, representing the next space to be crossed. Terrain cards show a number of tracks ranging from 0 to 3 and require from 6 to 10 tracks to cross depending on the type of terrain. In turn order, players flip additional terrain cards, and decide whether to build (cross terrain) or pass. When a terrain is crossed, the card is flipped face down and the player who completed the crossing receives back a number of pounds as indicated on the card. The track-building phase continues until one player has no terrain cards lying in front of their train, at which time a new set of terrain cards are auctioned.

Your objective is to capture all your opponents' castles, so that you are the last player remaining in the game.<br/><br/>This game in the Risk family of games is markedly different than the original Risk. The combat mechanism is the same but players receive armies at the end of the turn, not the beginning (the sole exception being playing a Reinforcements card). The game has no territory cards, and one does not get armies based on the total number of individual territories. One gets armies for regions controlled and banners in one's castle only. Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.<br/><br/>The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy).

2558,Comeback,['Auction/Bidding'],['Card Game'],"Another in the line of very small card games by Reinhard Staupe. The deck consists of four suits of cards numbered 1 to 7. The 1s have three stars, the 2s have two stars and all other cards have one star. Players start with 150 points (which serves as a starting score and a money pool for bidding). For 2 players, use 16 cards, for 3 players use 21 cards, for 4 players use 24 cards (so that players do not know which cards are in play) and these are auctioned off one at a time. Bid increments must be at least as great as the number of the card being auctioned but can be more - i.e. while bidding on a card with the number 4, a bid of four would require a bid of 8 or more from the next bidder). The first bid can be lower, the same or higher than the number of the card.  Bidding goes clockwise around the table.  First bid also moves clockwise around the table. When all cards have been auctioned, suits are scored separately for each player by adding the card numbers and multiplying that figure by the total number of stars in the suit. Scores for each suit are added to any remaining points from a players' starting pool (points remaining from the original pool of 150) to determine the final score.

Players each have 2 pawns, 9 green walls (which are placed vertically), and 9 blue walls (placed horizontally). Pawns start on the color matching them, which are 4x4 squares in on each of the four corners of the 11x14 board. The object is simple: to get one of your pawns to a starting spot of your opponent. Each turn players can move one pawn up to two spaces, and also place one wall, useful for blocking off their opponent's move. Walls always cover two squares worth of area, and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.<br/><br/>This game is one of a series of 2 player strategy games by Lakeside from the 1970s.<br/><br/>",1975,,,

2561,Dixie-Pollyanna,"['Dice Rolling', 'Race', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Static Capture']","['Abstract Strategy', 'Novel-based', 'Racing']","Pollyanna is a race/pursuit game published by Parker Brothers between 1915 and 1967.  During those years, several editions appeared with differing artwork and game pieces.  Some of these editions are entitled Dixie or Dixie-Pollyanna and some are subtitled &quot;The Great Home Game,&quot; &quot;The Glad Game,&quot; or &quot;Parker Brothers Track Pursuit Game.&quot; In 1917 it was completely rethemed as The Popular Game of Broadway, with artwork of New York scenes featuring famous buildings of the time.  Pollyanna itself gets its name from the title of the 1913 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter.  Each piece color in the game is associated with one of the characters in the novel.  In the original 1915 edition blue was Aunt Polly; green was Nancy; red was Jimmy; and yellow was John Pendleton.  These color associations changed in future editions.<br/><br/>The game is widely recognized as a variant of Parcheesi, which is itself derived from Pachisi, a classic game of India.  The object of Pollyanna, as in all games of the Pachisi family, is to be the first player to move his or her four men from the start space around the board to the home space.  During the course of the game, players may also land on single opposing pieces and send them back to start.  Two or three opposing pieces on the same space can neither be captured nor passed.<br/><br/>Pollyanna differs from Parcheesi in several important ways.<br/><br/><br/>     The track is laid out as a square and is 62 spaces long between start and home (in Parcheesi it is laid out as a cross and is 72 spaces long); furthermore Pollyanna employs four turnouts&mdash;short semi-circular paths off the main path (known as the broadway).  Only single pieces may occupy a turnout space, but pieces there may not be passed and are invulnerable to capture.  Turnouts are the most important difference between Pollyanna and Parcheesi.  They make the two games play quite differently.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The bonus move for capturing an opponent's piece is only 10 spaces, and there is no bonus for a piece reaching home (in Parcheesi these pay a 20-space and 10-space bonus respectively).  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Doubles are handled differently. In Pollyanna each double earns the right to another roll, provided that the player was able to use both dice. (In Parcheesi, on the third consecutive roll of doubles a player loses his/her turn and must return one of his pieces to start.) In addition, only the obverse faces of dice are counted in doubles.  (In Parcheesi, both the obverse faces and reverse faces of the dice are counted.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Up to three pieces of the same color may occupy a space on the broadway.  This effectively means that a player can pass his or her own blockade, by first landing exactly on the blockade and joining it, and then moving on.  This is not possible in Parcheesi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pieces are started on a roll of six (on either of the two dice or as the sum of the two dice).  In Parcheesi, the roll required is a five.  This means that starting a piece in Pollyanna is somewhat easier than in Parcheesi.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>     There are safe spaces for each color; there are no general safe spaces.  If a pawn is on a safe space of its own color no other player's pawn may land there, but it may pass through.  <br/><br/><br/>",1915,,,

The table value determines how many hot dogs can be sold at that table.<br/>The remaining dollar cards are sorted according to value (1, 5, 10 $) and also placed on the table. The start player gets the ketchup/mustard card.<br/><br/>All players simultaneously decide at which table and how many hot dogs they want to sell.

They can also put down dollar cards to reduce the price of their hot dogs.<br/>When all players have made their decision, the cards are revealed and tallied up, beginning with the lowest table. <br/>When several players want to sell at the same table, the player who wants to sell the lowest number of hot dogs at this table puts them next to the table first, followed by the player who wants to sell the second lowest number at that table etc. Once the number of hot dogs from the players' cards has reached the maximum specified on the table, no other players can sell hot dogs there and any unsold hot dog cards are returned to that player's hand. Dollar cards are used to indicate that a player sells his/her hot dogs cheaper, and this changes the order in which players are allowed to sell (e.g. a player with 5 hot dogs minus $ 2 is allowed to sell before a player with 4 hot dogs because his/her total of 3 is lower than the other player's 4). If hot dog prices are equal, the player with the ketchup/mustard card goes first.<br/>As soon as a table is full, each player receives one dollar for each hot dog he/she has at this table.<br/>At the end of the round, each player takes back the table card he/she played and the ketchup/mustard card is passed on to the next player.<br/>A new sales round starts.<br/>When someone plays out his/her last hot dog card(s), he has to announce this by saying &quot;last hot dog&quot;, otherwise he may not sell them.

This version sees the game revert back to the original Warlord with new rules to reflect over thirty years of play.<br/><br/>Objective - to dominate the board and destroy opponents.<br/><br/>Mechanics - similar to Risk, you get more armies for the more territories you hold. Allocation is on basis of territory held: city, industrial or agricultural.  Mountainous, waste, and sea spaces gain you no armies.<br/><br/>Gaining territories through combat is an elegant use of cunning and bluff.  Instead of rolling dice, the attacker simply chooses with a single D6 how many pieces they wish to attack with (subject to restrictions based on terrain).  The D6 is then concealed and the defender attempts to guess it.  If they guess correctly the attacker loses that number of armies; if they guess wrongly one defender is lost, and if the territory is now left unoccupied the selected number of attacking pieces or greater are advanced into the territory to capture it.<br/><br/>Alliances are allowed (and can be broken at will).<br/><br/>A-bombs and the more devastating H-bombs are used in the game.  A-bombs are a reward for successful combat, and H-bombs are gained as a result of launching an A-bomb.

Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance. The rest of the Norwegian Arctic is mountainous and can be a formidable barrier if well defended. The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.<br/><br/>The complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated.

Both sides try to gain control of the various Iranian factions and influence the other Middle Eastern nations. As the superpowers' confrontation continues, fighting breaks out between committed factions. Either side can decide to send troops to support their factions; the U.S. may send the Rapid Deployment Force while the Soviet Union may use its forces along its southern borders and in Afghanistan. Each move, however, escalates the conflict until the superpowers are directly fighting one another in the Middle East and their alliances in Europe are mobilizing for war.<br/><br/>The four game maps cover the Persian Gulf region in detail. Centered on Iran and Iraq, the maps include bordering areas of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the USSR, and Afghanistan. Mountains and sand dominate this area of the world, and wilderness rules show the effects of the scarcity of roads on military operations. <br/>Vying for control of the nations on these maps are the regional forces and those of the superpowers. These forces range greatly in capabilities: from the poorly-equipped and trained Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Soviet-controlled Afghan Army to the capable Turks to the elite Israeli and Jordanian intervention contingents. The Soviets have large forces available in their southern border regions and in Afghanistan. The small but strong U.S. RDF is on hand, and they can call on B-52 strikes for support.<br/><br/>The rules cover the special political and military situations of the Middle East and the various Arab and Arab-Israeli rivalries are shown. Victory conditions take account of the oil resources of the Gulf. Additional rules allow Persian Gulf to be combined and played with the other three games in the Third World War series.<br/><br/>",1986,,,

2603,Der Herr der Ringe Sammelkartenspiel,['Hand Management'],"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Novel-based']","A tradeable card game covering the events of the Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo and his companions journey from Bag End to the destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom. The coverage of the cards is largely loyal to the movies, but it does take some of its lore from the book, and make references to certain atmospheres within the book. Some card sets, such as the Expanded Middle Earth Draft collection, have actors playing roles that were not seen in the movie, replete with costume. This allows for Tom Bombadil and Ghan Buri Ghan (among others) to be considered part of the card game. Nonetheless, they are rare, and typically you feel as if you are playing the movie rather than the book.<br/><br/>The game will be fairly familiar to veteran CCG players with a couple of important exceptions: firstly, combat is magic-like in execution but more incremental in resolution: each &quot;lost&quot; combat results in only a wound, not elimination as in Magic, L5R, Star Wars, or most other CCGs. Each character can suffer a limited number of wounds before being eliminated, but this &quot;health&quot; rating is also expended for card special actions - there is no &quot;tapping&quot;. Also importantly, this is not a &quot;draw one&quot; game but a &quot;hand-filling&quot; game, which results in a very different dynamic. Lastly, like ICEs Middle-Earth CCG that came before, cards are either &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;shadow&quot; cards; when you play Free Peoples cards in your turn, you effectively pay their cost in Twilight Points to your opponent, who then turns around and uses those points to play Shadow Cards to attack you.<br/><br/>As a final comment, Decipher finally saw the light and put a 4-card cap on every card during deck building (and this includes variations; so there is an Aragorn: Ranger of the North and an Aragorn: King in Exile; you can only have total of 4 combined). Additionally, there is a much more sane rarity distribution than previous Decipher products (many - in fact most - familiar characters are common or uncommon, or at least have common or uncommon variations that are no less powerful than the rare versions).<br/><br/>This game &quot;ended&quot; when Decipher ran into financial difficulties and let the license expire.

These games were each designed by Harry Gibson<br/><br/>",1925,,,
2606,Dover Patrol,"['Grid Movement', 'Memory', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Square Grid']","['Nautical', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","Wonderful Naval tactics game of skill. This game DOVER PATROL along with L'Attaque and Aviation: The Aerial Tactics Game of Attack and Defence were each designed by Harry Gibson along with a more complicated incorporation of all three, a game called  Tri-Tactics<br/><br/>Note: L'Attaque was patented in 1909 in France by a woman with a French name.  Whether Harry Gibson designed that game is therefore open to some doubt.<br/><br/>Stratego is very much like L'Attaque, published after World War II when the patent would have expired.<br/><br/>The board, which supposedly represents an area of sea, is superimposed with a rectangular grid. A Base is shown on two of the opposite edges of the board. The area round each base is protected by a harbour wall.<br/><br/>Each player has a fleet of forty playing pieces. These pieces are rectangles of cardboard which stand upon plastic supports. The two sides are distinguished by the colour on the back of each card, red and blue in this case. The fronts of the cards depict various ships, mines and a flying boat. Each piece has a printed value from 1 for a Patrol Vessel to 10 for the Flagship. These values represent the relative strength of each ship and also indicate the type of ship; battle cruisers, light cruisers, etc.. The ships are also named, H.M.S. Lion, H.M.S. Glasgow and so on. The object of the game is to capture the enemy Flag and transport it back to one's own base while still retaining possession of one's own Flag.<br/><br/>To start the game, the players place their Flag on their Base and then set up their pieces, one per rectangle, on their own side of the board and with the backs of the cards facing the opponent. In turn the players move a piece one space orthogonally until two opposing pieces are back-to-back. The moving player may then call 'Attack', the two relevant pieces are then revealed and the one with the lower value is sunk and removed from the board.<br/><br/>In addition to the fighting ships, the players have a number of auxiliary pieces. Mines will automatically blow up virtually all ships that are moved into an attacking position, regardless of whether the owner of the moving ship attacks or not. Once placed, mines may not be moved. Only the mine sweepers can destroy mines. The mine layers act as floating mines. They can be moved but may not attack, but have the same effect upon enemy shipping as a mine. Only the destroyers can sink them. Submarines have a marauding role and can sink all ships except mine layers and MTB's. The good old flying boat has a very important role as it is principally used to capture the enemy flag because it can fly over the harbour walls. Only MTB's and destroyers can shoot it down. When the opposing flag is captured, it is clipped to the top of the capturing piece and thus its whereabouts are known to all. The Flag can be transferred to any other piece standing orthogonally adjacent to the piece which is transporting it.<br/><br/>It is a fairly straightforward game to play, though tactics can well be employed, particularly in the setting up phase.<br/><br/>",1919,,,

However, many players elect to use later rules editions and make the money count as the measure of the game. Starting with &pound;700, each player can buy horses and/or businesses in two steps, first by lot and then by auction. Then the players make one lap around the Training Track of the gameboard with each of their horses. Here the players collect advantage and disadvantage cards to be used in the race. Also on the Training Track, the players gain or lose money that can be bet on the race. Once the players have circumnavigated the Training Track, the gameboard is flipped to reveal the Race Track.<br/><br/>The players may enter only 3 horses into the race. The players may bet on any horse to win. After the betting is over the race begins. The players roll one die and move their horses in turn, utilizing the cards earned during the first half of the game whenever it is felt to be advantageous. The players who bet on the winning horse divide the money bet on the race minus ten percent (that goes to the Bookmaker).<br/><br/>",1938,,,

Its size is dictated by the three randomizing discs embedded in its base, which are used to generate a new playing area every time (there are 1,728 (12^3) different setups possible).<br/><br/>You buy properties, drill for oil, link properties with pipelines so as to collect royalties and try to be the richest player.  Event cards complicate matters.  Drilling is resolved with a little rig whose plunger is pushed up if it doesn't go through the hidden disc; if it pushes through all three, the well is dry.  Deeper holes cost more, of course.<br/><br/>Pipelines can be bought once you have 4 producing oil wells on a property; they reach across that property's boundary to another player's property, and are used to siphon royalties from him every turn.

2609,Das Störrische Muli,['Roll / Spin and Move'],"['Dice', 'Racing']","The game is quite simple and definitely family fare. Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.<br/><br/>The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.<br/><br/>If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

The situation is that of the beginning of the film.  Players secretly place swimmers on individual boards with the aim of recreating the exact placement of the swimmers on the game board.<br/><br/>The game is played with 19 small rocks in grey, brown, yellow or white and beautiful handmade materials, and is performed in two parts.  During the first part the stones are placed onto the playing field via auctions.  Two stones at a time are drawn from the bag and auctioned by having each player bidding using one big and one small card.  The small cards have a value from 1 to 3, the big from 1 to 12.  The player with the highest product of the two cards may place both stones onto the board.  The big card is removed from the game, the small card will stay open until the last card of the same type is played.   Only after 3 bidding rounds will you get more small cards in your hand.<br/><br/>The idea is to place the stones in the right order, which is stated on the card you have hidden from your opponents. You may score a row or column five times during the game even when it isn't your turn. When both color and position match you you place a so-called &quot;2F&quot; or &quot;3F&quot; marker at the row/column which will bring you 2 or 3 points for each correct stone - which can amount to quite a good score in the long 5 stone row. If only the color, but not the position, is correct you use the &quot;2A&quot; or &quot;1A&quot; markers.  One or two points per stone won't get you far, especially in the short 3-stone row, but the most important aspect is not to use the markers too soon.  Firstly, because you cannot score a particular row/column more than once, secondly because you can get your points in the second half of the game.<br/><br/>When all stones have been placed onto the board the second half of the game beings.  Here you may rearrange the stones. Before the game is over you may you exchange two stones with each other five times.  You shouldn't use your 2- or 3-marker on the short rows/columns, but rather concentrate on the longer. The board has two 5-, four 4- and four 3-rows, and if you don't get the maximum points early in the game will you have to look foolishly on as your opponent places his markers on the two 5- and three of the 4-rows to score maximum points.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

Only 1 card is up for bid  and the remaining face-up card is put aside.<br/><br/>Final score<br/>First the red cards are totaled, then the green in the same manner. Each player adds the values of his red cards. The player with the most red cards doubles the sum of his red cards; all others receive only their normal red-card points. If several players tie for the most red cards, all these players double their red points.<br/><br/>The points for the red and green cards are added. Minus points are subtracted.

The game mechanics is similar to TAC, Super Tock 4, Super Tock 6, Tock 6, Super Tock 8, and Partners<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move your tokens from home to the target area as quickly as possible, moving them in a clockwise direction along the course according to the value of the cards. Whichever team first places all eight of its tokens in the target area wins.<br/><br/>The first twist in Dog is that play is based on a hand of cards held by each player, with the start player and the quantity of cards cycling on successive hands from six cards to two, then resetting to five, then progressing back to two. Card values range from 1-13, with a number of special actions represented.<br/><br/>The second twist is that Dog is a partnership game, with the players winning or losing as a team, which adds a significant level of strategy and tactics to the game. Partners trade one card at the beginning of each round, and once one player from a partnership has completed his group, his plays now assist his partner.<br/><br/>Compact Dog is a travel version of Dog that's limited to four players instead of allowing for play with either four or six players, as in the full game.<br/><br/>",1997,,,

2635,The Fascinating Game of Finance,['Roll / Spin and Move'],['Economic'],"In 1932, Finance was first published through L. S. Ayres &amp; Co, and then by Electronic Laboratories. The name was changed to Finance after legal council advised game developer Dan Layman that the name &quot;Monopoly&quot; was (at that time) in the public domain.<br/><br/>Lizzie Magie first copyrighted the game in 1903, in slightly different form, under the name The Landlord's Game, and this game was made by hand in small quantities and was distributed mostly by individuals.  At this time, the name &quot;Monopoly&quot; was first used to describe the game.<br/><br/>Though slight differences appeared in regional play of the game, the game was remarkably similar to the Darrow version of Monopoly.  Parker Brothers wanted to promote the Charles Darrow version of the game, even though they knew that it was not Mr. Darrow's creation.<br/><br/>However, Dan Layman had already published Finance, and the game had been around for years. According to a Time Magazine article dated February 17th, 1936:<br/><br/>&quot;I wrote the entire rulebook for the game of Finance in 1931 (copyrighted 1932) and simplified the old game of Monopoly for manufacturing purposes...&quot; --Dan Layman<br/><br/>&quot;Almost exactly this same game as played at Williams was put on the market in Indianapolis early in 1932 through L. S. Ayres &amp; Co. The name was changed to Finance for trademark reasons... &quot;<br/><br/>This was the only article published which contradicted what would become Parker Brothers' assertion that it had published the original Monopoly, and that Layman's version was a spin-off.<br/><br/>In 1936, Layman had forced the retraction by Time of an article from two weeks earlier, titled &quot;Monopoly and Politics&quot;.  What was unknown to Time was that Layman had sold Finance to a small games manufacturer, David W. Knapp, the originator of the popular 1930s games &quot;Krazy-Ikes&quot; and the &quot;Knapp Electric Questioner&quot;.<br/> Knapp's Finance game was stiff competition to Darrow's Monopoly, and outsold it at a 10 to 1 ratio. In fact, Knapp Electric had just begun national distribution. To eliminate this legal and commercial threat to their newly acquired Monopoly game, Parker Brothers purchased the rights to Finance from Knapp for $10,000 -- a significant sum at the time. But it was a far cry from the millions in royalties that were paid to Charles Darrow.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers changed Finance so it was less similar to Monopoly and in 1935 created a front organization called the Finance Game Company in order to market the game. Parker Brothers made additional changes in 1936 and published it with the Parker Brothers name, after which the Finance Game Company was never heard from again.<br/><br/>",1932,,,

2638,"Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914","['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Wargame', 'World War I']","Clash of Giants contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering the two most famous battles of the opening phase of the First World War. Tannenberg was the German victory that halted a Russian offensive into East Prussia and destroyed the Russian 2nd Army. The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.<br/><br/>Designed by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.<br/><br/>Clash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.<br/><br/>Simple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack. (But don't forget that the Germans can win instantly if they take Paris!)<br/><br/>The two battles in Clash of Giants [...] are good for solo or competitive play. The Marne (which contains an Allied Counterattack scenario in addition to the full campaign) can be played in an afternoon. Tannenberg can be completed in a couple of hours, making it the perfect game when time is short.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:    1-2 days per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     4.5/3.3 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Divisions and brigades<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One or two<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>        264 full-color counters<br/>        Two 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>        8-page Rulebook<br/>        12-page Battle Book<br/>        2 Player Aid cards<br/>        One 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT Games website)<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).<br/><br/>Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.<br/><br/>You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each &quot;Dip&quot; rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the &quot;cancel dip&quot; die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

Each player is assigned an area of the board, containing three land sections and building lots of different colours (red, yellow, orange or blue).  The object of the game is to be the first to build all of your nine buildings.<br/><br/>On your turn, you gamble for income.  The income die is rolled; if it comes up on its red dot face, you don't get any money.  Otherwise, you get the amount indicated and may roll again --but if you roll the red dot, you lose any income for the turn!  Income is doubled once you've completed all three buildings of one of your land sections, tripled once you've completed two sections.<br/><br/>Next, you draw an Opportunity card and resolve it.  You may buy a Town Meeting card; these cards are either Legal Action or Defence cards (this is kept secret until used).  Finally, you may improve a property (from its undeveloped state), or build a resort on it (once improved) --if you have the money.  The properties have varying degrees of risk associated with them (the Opportunity cards) and consequently varying building costs.<br/><br/>When you complete a building, the other players may play Legal Action cards (up to five), each of which places a red marble in the gavel device.  You automatically get a green marble, and may add up to four more by using your Defence cards.  The gavel is then shaken and then held up so marbles roll into the handle; a window at the handle's end reveals who won.  If the opponents win, the builder does not get his building (and has lost the money) and the opponents get money from the bank for their trouble.<br/><br/>",1974,,,

Each spider has two long flexible legs with which it steps over the web; each leg ends in a peg which fits into holes in the web.  The catch is that if you insert your peg in a hole occupied by an opponent's spider, it pushes his peg out.  A spider hanging by only one leg is a &quot;dangler&quot; and is in danger of being pushed off the web altogether (and out of the game) should the opponent push its other leg out.  Re-attaching a dangler uses up one's entire turn.<br/><br/>The object of the game is either to eliminate all of the opponent's spiders or put a leg in his nest.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move two different legs, belonging to the same or two different spiders.  The small spiders' leg span confines them to adjacent holes.  The big spider, the Daddy Long Leg, has a greater span and can use holes two spaces apart.

This continues until one player is satisfied with the mix achieved in his/her 7-card hand and calls &quot;Snap.&quot; At that point, the &quot;hot phase&quot; begins, with players slapping cards at will - although one at a time - on the discard pile. When two cards with with matching color are placed one over the other, that suit becomes the winning suit. Players then score points for cards of that color in their hand. Players also score for all other cards of any color with numbers matching their winning-suit cards remaining in other players' hands (except for cards valued 10 and above). It is suggested to play as many rounds as players in the game, with the player achieving the most points overall winning.<br/><br/>",1997,,,

A Mighty Fortress is designed with a mechanical simplicity that is matched only by the subtlety of the game's interplay among contesting forces.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress simulates the conditions, which made possible the spread of the Lutheran Reformation and the subsequent Catholic reaction (the Counter-Reformation) in the years 1532-1555. The game recreates the actual historical objectives of the major countries in Europe in the Sixteenth Century as well as their military strengths and resources. There are six players in the game representing the six major countries, England, France, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburgs, the Pope, and the collection of German states we will call The Lutherans.<br/><br/>The Lutheran player is intent on promoting the Protestant cause throughout Europe, and the Papacy is equally resolved to gather any straying nations back into the Catholic fold. The Hapsburg Empire -- strong in arms and sprawling across half the continent -- seeks to maintain its possessions in the face of pressure from all directions. In England, Henry VIII is engaged with his own confrontation with the Pope; and French forces are marshalling to dismantle the Hapsburg dominions. And Suleiman the Magnificent is constantly watching for the opportunity to expand his Ottoman empire -- at anyone's expense.<br/><br/>The Hapsburgs have, by far, the largest number of combat forces. Unhindered by other problems, they could easily suppress Lutheranism. However, other players have objectives that can usually be achieved only at the expense of the mighty Hapsburgs. Therefore, depending on the rapidly shifting political situation, there will probably be several alliances against Hapsburg influence. Because of this convoluted political situation, the players will often find themselves at cross-purposes with other players whom they were aiding the Game-Turn before. Thus, the possibilities for political and military interaction are extensive.<br/><br/>A Mighty Fortress covers the twenty-four years from 1532 to 1555 -- a period fraught with shifting alliances, political and religious fervor, and frantic efforts to shift the balance of power. Theological debates, treaties of peace, declarations of war, excommunication, taxation, and missionaries -- all are included in this simulation of one of the most violent and implacably hostile eras of European history. The game covers all actions from the year 1532 -- right after formation of the Schmalkaldic League -- until 1555 and the Peace of Augsburg, which guaranteed Lutheranism as a religion [sic] and allowed the German estates to choose between that and Catholicism.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>Special rules include those for missionaries, conversion, peace treaties, formal alliances, truces, ultimata, ceding territory, income and borrowing, theological debates, excommunication, Henry VIII's divorce and hidden, variable victory conditions.<br/>Counters = 200<br/><br/>Other credits:<br/><br/>Graphic Design: Redmond A.

Each player is head of a large business conglomerate and is striving to be the most influential and powerful leader in the Hong Kong business community. The route to power lies in the manipulations of the stock market, banks, and holding companies, and other typical corporate skull duggery.<br/><br/>Synopsis of play:<br/><br/>During a turn, players draw event cards, which can be used in many ways to affect one's own future, or the future of an opponent. Players then buy and sell stocks on a volatile stock market, which can fluctuate due to purchase and sale of stocks, failed contracts, or even loss of face (bad faith deals). Contracts are then announced, and if a player has sufficient assets, and can maintain those assets, lots of money can be made. Unfulfilled contracts go up for a general bid amongst the players. Players can then attempt to acquire loans from 3 Hong Kong banks, but, if the Bank Directors, or their proxies, so vote, a player can simply be denied a loan. Furthermore, bank directors, in the person of voting cards held by players, can call in outstanding loans, which must be immediately paid. Players now purchase various assets, such as airlines, railroads, shipping lines, industry, land, and human services, which the player must have to fulfill contractual obligations. Players can buy their own assets, or even lease them from other players. All possible wheeling and dealing is allowed, and no one is ever required to keep his or her end of a bargain. Lastly, if a player's stock falls far enough, and they have been unfortunate enough to lose enough of their own &quot;voting&quot; stock, they can be voted out of the game, which will end the game at the end of that phase.

2736,The Lonely Mountain,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Role Playing']","['Fantasy', 'Wargame']","Lonely Mountain is an adventure game played by 1 to 6 players. Each player controls a group of adventurers attempting to sneak into the Lonely Mountain (Erebor) and steal as much loot as possible. However, they must escape before Smaug the Dragon awakens, discovers their trespasses, and slays them all. The game takes place relatively soon after Smaug attacked and drove out the Dwarves in Third Age 2770. At that time, Smaug had not yet sealed all of the minor entrances to Erebor, and he considered the entire inner complex of rooms and tunnels to be his &quot;lair&quot;. Thus adventurers can enter (and hopefully leave) in a variety of ways. A raid such as the one this game depicts could have been the event that caused Smaug to close all the minor entrances and to gather most of Erebor&acute;s loot into one huge pile.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board representing the inner complex of rooms and tunnels where Smaug and most of the &quot;treasure&quot; of the Lonely Mountain reside. The board is highly abstracted and simplified to make play quick and easy. Four of the available groups of adventurers represent the interests of the four major races of Middle-earth: Dwarves, Elves, Men, and Orcs. The &quot;Freebooters&quot; are an independent group of adventurers out for glory and loot. Each group has the same mix of 10 characters: 1 Mage, 1 Animist, 1 Bard, 1 Ranger, 2 Scouts, 2 Archers, and 2 Fighters.<br/><br/>",1984,,,

2738,Die Gnümies,"['Auction/Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']","['Card Game', 'Fantasy']","OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. <br/>2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. <br/>3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. <br/>4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. <br/>5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. <br/>6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.<br/><br/>7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!<br/><br/>8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).<br/><br/>9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.<br/><br/>10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!<br/><br/>10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!<br/><br/>Ages 8 and up<br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel<br/><br/><br/>",2001,,,

2742,Wings: A Game of Plane to Plane Combat in World War I,"['Action Queue', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']","['Aviation / Flight', 'Wargame', 'World War I']","&quot;A game of plane to plane combat in World War I&quot;<br/><br/>There is plenty of goodies in the box, including three geomorphic map boards, plenty of thick counters, and as much rules as you can stomach. Luckily, you can select both your level of realism (i.e. complexity: ranging from the Mass Game to the Duel Game) and the length of the scenario (30 min to 4 hours), so the game is pretty flexible in this regard.<br/><br/>(what follows is abstracted from the ZOCO Historical Simulations Archive review)<br/><br/>Wings is a simultaneous movement job and can get pretty complex. This is traditional heavy duty boardgaming, not as complex as Advanced Squad Leader but harder than Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men and only workable with very few planes per player. Thankfully the rules do not all have to be used and Wings works pretty well with basic rules, with some of the advanced and optionals as required. The advanced rules are supposed to be used as a block but consist largely of tricky maneuvers as opposed to the turns and slides of the basic rules. A simpler fleet-style game using plenty of planes is also provided. The scenarios provided include the legendary Wings 6 hex Zeppelin counter, boat targets, bombing, trench-strafing and photo runs.<br/><br/>The basic problem of WWI air combat as presented in Wings is that the planes are not very good, not very fast, grossly underpowered, turn poorly and chances are that when they get a shot off they tend to miss. As a result, there is a lot of manoeuvring (more than the columns provided on the plotting pad) and relatively little damage (it could have been jotted down separately instead of occupying part of the pad). 3-D is simulated through altitude levels (0 to the 800s --although many planes will not get that high); planes go faster when diving and lose speed when climbing. Go too slow and you will stall and spin downwards until you can pick up enough speed or crash.<br/><br/>Simultaneous movement games often involve a lot of ESP because it is hard to tell where the opposition is going. Things are not so bad in Wings because planes have bank attitudes showing which way they lean, like in Blue Max. Turning, manoeuvring and climbing restrictions are such that you can narrow down the other plane's intent by carefully paying attention to its banking attitude. Likewise, firing arcs are restricted, and the penalties for firing in a turn and the like are pretty steep, so naturally a plane that thinks it has a good shot will keep pretty straight and level, not too hard to out-manoeuvre. The general problem of planes chasing each other over an endless sky and having limited powers of turning and climbing means they will not often be in each other's guns. Having missed, it will take some time for the planes to all move around back into suitable combat positions. The game is considerably improved by having more than 1 plane on each side, thus ameliorating the chance of someone being able to fire at someone else.<br/><br/>Gunnery is based on 2D6 rolled as 11 to 66 (a frequent mechanism in Yaquinto games). Results will rarely destroy a target on 1 hit but affect some part of the plane. When not hitting Structure, your hits will likely reduce the limited performance of the planes. Some hits can reduce the power rating of planes. If the target only has 1<br/>power to spend each turn and it loses that, then it is in trouble --it can no longer climb or turn without losing speed and will be forced to dive to get anywhere. It is thus more sensible to fly off when suitably blooded rather than prolonging the game as planes slowly drag themselves back into combat.<br/><br/>Solitaire gaming works quite well because the rules severely limit what a plane can do so the guessing is kept low. Play actually improves with more players as this generates more opportunities for mayhem. 50 plane types are provided although Yaquinto never published Wings II so other planes are referred to in the force tables that have no details (although it just may be possible to figure out those &quot;missing&quot; planes' characteristics from their counterparts in Blue Max and Knights of the Air). The planes are rated differently, but unfortunately performance varies with altitude so you need to check the plane reference card frequently --whilst the gun data is on the opposite side of the card.<br/><br/>",1981,,,

Germany is a jigsaw puzzle of independent Electorates, Bishoprics, Dukedoms, and Imperial Free Cities nominally under the control of the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. An alliance of Protestant leaders rebel against the Emperor, who raises armies to suppress them and regain Catholic property lost during the Reformation; the surrounding kings of Spain, France, Sweden, and Denmark intervene to stake their own claims. Germany is plunged into thirty years of war that will last until 1648, when the exhausted combatants sign a peace establishing the competing spheres of interest that will control Germany for the next two centuries.<br/><br/>&quot;Thirty Years War&quot; recreates this conflict with the award winning wargame system used in GMT's Wilderness War, Paths of Glory, and For the People.

Playing a card gives a player the option to move and attack with an army, to recruit new units, to bank up money to pay ever-hungry troops, or to declare an event.<br/><br/>The Peace of Westphalia made certain that Germany would remain divided for another two centuries. Can the Catholic player defy history by recreating the power of the old Holy Roman Empire? Does Gustavus Adolphus survive to dictate peace to the Emperor in Vienna?

Special cards include Strategic Bombing (which permanently reduces a player's hand size), New Front, Offensive/Supply (which launches or sustains an offensive, or can be used to shift Airborne combat cards between fronts).<br/><br/>Points are scored mostly during offensives; every turn an offensive goes on, the difference between the attacker's total offense and the defender's total defense is scored by the stronger side.

Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.<br/><br/>On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.<br/><br/>Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would &quot;Build eights&quot; with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to &quot;Match eights&quot; on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build.

Each player's piece is moved according to throws of one or two dice. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a goose is depicted; landing on a goose allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards or lose one or more turns, the most recognizable being the one marked with a skull and symbolizing death; landing on this space results in the player being sent back to start. On Spanish boards the reverse is usually a Pachisi board.<br/><br/>Many themed versions of the game have been created, depicting topics as diverse as ice skating, Richard Nixon, and sewage pumps.

The object is to score points by collecting and then melding the cards, a la rummy.<br/>Players may meld numerical sequences of up to 11 cards, scoring 1 point for each card in the meld. These sequences must be along the top row dice face of the cards. Bonus points are scored for also forming certain combinations along the bottom row. For example, a sequence showing Red 1/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/6 would score 16 points; 4 points for the 1,2,3,4 sequence along the top row, multiplied by 2 for all the cards being the same color, multiplied by 2 again for the 4,5,6 sequence along the bottom. There are several other bonuses which may be scored. <br/>The mechanics of the game are very simple. Several cards will be face up on the table at any one time. Each player may roll up to 3 of their 4 dice in an attempt to capture 1 or more of these cards.<br/>Cards are captured by rolling the two numbers corresponding to the two dice on a card. Thus, rolling a 1, 4, 5 will allow you to capture a 5/1, a 4/1 or a 5/4 card, provided they are available.<br/>If a player rolls just one of the numbers on a card that he/she wants, that player may &quot;reserve&quot; that card by placing the single dice on the card. If the player subsequently rolls the second number in a later turn, he/she can take the card. Reserved cards may still be captured by other players.<br/> ",2001,,,

Players move one or more of over 130 counters that represent individual ships over a large (42&quot; x 27-1/2&quot;) four pieceqeomorphlc mapboard as they attempt to outmaneuver and out-shoot their opponents. 45 ship specification cards give such vital information as the number, size, location and play of individual guns that are fired separately using specific range and penetration tables for each weapon. The ship specification card also contains target information for such areas as; armor, siding, decking, smoke stack, hull, pilot house, waterline, crew and gun hits.

2801,Goldraub in London,[],"['Deduction', 'Murder/Mystery', 'Novel-based']","Components of &quot;Gold Robbery in London&quot; include 1 game board, 37 sector cards, 12 tip cards, 1 search block, 6 wooden pawns and 1 marker.  The game seems based on the work of Edgar Wallace (1875&ndash;1932), author of more than 150 detective and adventure novels. The numbers on the hexagonal board correspond to those on the sector cards. Tip cards either say &quot;false tip&quot; or &quot;gold bar&quot;. Each player receives a copy of the police gazette, one of each of the two types of tip cards and three sector cards.<br/>Each player tries to find out what cards the other players have. Landing on a space, the player asks and if players have the corresponding cards, they show the positive tip card, otherwise they show the negative card.  Each player also gets to find out what the player to their right showed. When someone feels they have located the exact place where gold has been hidden, he can interrupt the game and see if he is right.  If correct, he gets a huge bonus, but if wrong takes a major hit to his score.<br/><br/>2 years later described in Reinhold Wittig's SPIELECOLLECTION No. 1 Spiele zur Schatzinsel (1988) as &quot;Versteckt und Entdeckt&quot;.<br/><br/>",1986,,,
2802,War in Europe,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Economic', 'Political', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.<br/><br/>The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.<br/><br/>The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.<br/><br/>Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.<br/><br/>Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.<br/><br/>Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.<br/><br/>Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.<br/><br/>The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.<br/><br/>The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.<br/><br/>The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.<br/><br/>A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.<br/><br/>The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.<br/><br/>The game contains: <br/>- 3600 counters<br/><br/>        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)<br/>        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)<br/>        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)<br/><br/><br/>- Nine maps (A-H,J)<br/>- Four Rulebooks<br/><br/>        (Standard Rules)<br/>        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)<br/>        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)<br/>        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)<br/><br/><br/>- Axis Production Spiral<br/>- Soviet Production Spiral<br/>- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track<br/>- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track <br/>- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track<br/>- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables<br/>- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables<br/><br/>",1976,,,

Twenty-four &quot;spokes&quot; combine with them to form a grid. Players each have a wooden balloon which shows its altitude by stacking it up, insecurely it seems, on small wooden disks. They also receive at start four ascent cards and four descent (gas bottle) cards. A wooden arrow on a disk at the center shows the current wind direction.<br/><br/>Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or &quot;fox hunt&quot; and a target race.

The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.<br/><br/>When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.<br/><br/>An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game.

The large board is themed with the signs of the Zodiac and has 5 concentric rings (orbits) and spirals forming the path of life. There is a large (11cm) latex statuette of Lady Luck and players spend tokens, representing years of their life, to an altar to move themselves and the statuette around the board. They can also block spaces with fire tokens. When each player has spent all its tokens, it has died. When the last player dies, whoever Fortune is nearest to, first collects tokens from the altar as a multiple of their age (the orbit they reached) by the number of players. The next player does the same, but multiplied by one less and so on. Presumably the basic game ends with the player with the most tokens winning (the rules don't say!). The advanced game rules allow additional variants, such as bidding or bartering or a quiz based game. One variant goes on to use the won tokens as the start of the After-Life and the designer, Dr Bronia Grycz, encourages players to develop their own rules.

There are 256 trail tiles showing the parallel lines the skis make in the snow. These go in straight lines, diagonals, turns and sharp turns and a few have 2 trails making crossovers. Players draw ten tiles from the face-down pile and show them. The first player lays as many tiles as possible to make a ski trail down from the top of the hill avoiding the trees, then draws back to ten tiles. A player may choose to use its turn to swap tiles with the pool instead of playing. If your trail is totally blocked, you may remove tiles laid and try again. <br/>When a skier reaches the bottom of the hill, the others may finish their turns. Any finisher gets 25 bonus points, then each player scores their trail, according to the tiles they laid. The straights are worth 1 point, turns 2 pts, sharp turns 3 pts and crossovers are 10 pts. Then deduct the tiles left in hand and the highest total wins.<br/>In the solitaire game, the player draws 50 tiles and tries to make a trail using all 50.<br/><br/>The rules are in English, French and German and refer to the board as a plastic sheet rolled in a tube, presumably the earlier edition.

2864,Automania: The Game of the Motor Giants,"['Commodity Speculation', 'Secret Unit Deployment']","['Economic', 'Industry / Manufacturing']","Automania, The Game Of The Motor Giants, was Ian Livingstone's second self-produced game, after Boomtown, in a limited edition of 1000. The board is a simple scoring track and large flags for each country. Players have nice wooden car shaped pieces in six colors and a larger car to score with. There is a numbered deck of 56 Market Cards in English and German which affect the game each round. Players use a Record Sheet and the rules are in English and German.<br/><br/>Players represent national car manufacturers trying to export cars to six other countries. Combining the placing some export cars in the markets on the board and secretly noting the remaining export cars on your Record Sheet, players also assign advertising budgets to the markets. Each market has a export limit that it can accept and the cars go for a fixed price in each market, so whoever spends more money on advertising gets to sell their cars first. But before revealing the spending, players play one of their Market Cards, which affect the Market in various ways (e.g. 36 - Car of the Year, Sweden will sell all its cars in the USA). After the market is reorganized, players then determine what cars are actually sold and how much Sales Revenue they have earned. Then subtract costs from sales to give profit. For each $10,000 profit you earn, you move your scoring marker one space on the scoring track. First round the track wins.<br/><br/>Reportedly a fun game, it drew some criticism in Sumo for the imbalance caused by the Market Cards. The designer replied and suggested which cards might stand removing (7 to 17, 26, 27 and 35). Ian's reply is on the Game Cabinet and makes interesting reading today.<br/><br/>",1991,,,

The cards are FOOD to be thrown (having a Splat Factor and Dodge Factor), DODGE to dodge food (having a Dodge Factor), EVENT cards (e.g. Catch, Grab, Oops, Butler etc.) to allow actions, and OBJECT cards (e.g. the host's furniture, paintings etc.). You play cards onto each other and draw from the table until the cards run out. If you dodge food, it might hit an object and the host will hassle the thrower (who misses goes). When players can no longer play cards, whoever has the least food on them is &quot;allowed to think they have won&quot;.<br/>The production is fairly simple, the graphics are basic (b &amp; w), and the rules are chatty and a bit unclear.

There is even a Record Book to keep a diary of your days by the lake.<br/>And days it will be, because, despite the wonderful attention to detail and genuine care taken in its making, this is a deadly dull game of dice rolling and dice rolling and dice rolling. You first seed the board with little paper tiles showing fish on one side &amp; their weight hidden below. Then you have to roll dice to walk round the lake to your chosen fishing spot (why???), roll dice to use the rowboat, roll dice to hook a fish, roll dice to reel it in, roll dice as the fish runs and so on. The cards are used as part of landing the fish, being Run, Hazard &amp; Problem cards. So it may run straight to you, but if it slips into the reeds, you lose your catch.<br/>No doubt habitual fishers will enjoy the tedium and it may well be a fine simulation of the sport, but any gamers will go mad.<br/><br/>Absolutely typical for a British product, a classic case of theme before game, no idea of a mechanism beyond dice and hazard cards.

On your turn, you buy into one firm or another by placing chips onto the board. Later you may sell your investment, making a profit or loss as the prices fluctuate. You draw a Fact Card, which gives info about the price of gold, the currency exchange rates, the FTSE index (the UK's Dow Jones) for a certain week. Based on that info, you decide if your shares will be up or down and whether to sell or hold. If you sell, the Banker checks the actual price in the Market booklet and debits or credits you accordingly. Rolling a VC on the die draws a Venture Card, with the usual hazards and gains to your cash.<br/>More of a crude stock market simulation than a game of strategy, the makers proposed selling fresh decks of Fact Cards and Market booklet for successive years.<br/><br/>",1986,,,

Bad pants, while recommended, are not required. <br/>Okay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Golfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Here's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a &quot;Hole&quot; card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.<br/><br/>Did you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points.

Fleets of havoc are patrolling ancient borders in space and impressive armadas, bent on destruction, are penetrating deep into enemy systems. It is a time of skill and cunning, a time of tactics and planning, it is a time of war. Armada is set in the rich and popular Twilight Imperium universe where players take control of one of the four major races of the crumbled empire, and must battle for glory and survival. Filled to the brim with ships of war, personnel, and technologies, Armada is a customizable game of strategic resource allocation and tactical space warfare.<br/><br/>Take control of the unique capabilities of each race's fleet:<br/><br/>Federation of Sol<br/>Sardakk N'orr<br/>Barony of Letnev<br/>Emirates of Hacan<br/><br/>Each ship is a die-cut counter that you move by &quot;flipping&quot; (Diskwars or Range Wars players will be familiar with this system). Each ship has their stats clearly printed on the tile so there are no sheets to cross reference. Combat is resolved by tossing Hit Counters to see how much damage you do. If the damage penetrates the opponent's shields, they must check for Critical Hits. This is an exciting alternative to dice rolling.<br/><br/>Overall a very fun and simple space combat game, not to mention an inexpensive alternative to miniatures.<br/><br/>Another note of interest, when the Star Trek Red Alert! game went out of print Fantasy Flight Games continued the game in their Twilight Imperium universe. The two games are compatible but the big difference is that Armada doesn't have cloaking technology but does have Squadrons. Squadrons are comprised of Fighters or Bombers and both are extremely nasty. If you play against an opponent with a Carrier, you're a sitting duck unless you include some fighters of your own.<br/><br/>The Twilight Imperium: Armada – Stellar Matter pack is the ultimate terrain expansion, with all the asteroids, mine fields, planets, space docks, and planetary defense systems you'll ever need.

2903,The Hunt for Red October,"['Area Movement', 'Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Simulation']","['Modern Warfare', 'Nautical', 'Novel-based', 'Wargame']","The Hunt for Red October depicts &quot;modern&quot; naval combat in the North Atlantic, Soviets vs. Nato.<br/><br/>The game contains 8 scenarios that place various combinations of aircraft, surface ships, and submarines at the players' disposal. The map is broken up into irregular &quot;spaces&quot; containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).<br/><br/>Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.<br/><br/>Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 &lt;= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.<br/><br/>Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.<br/><br/>",1988,,,
2904,John Prados' Third Reich,"['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']","['Economic', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","(from Avalanche Press website:)<br/><br/>Third Reich interweaves not only the land, naval and air struggles, but also the equally important economic and political battles. Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.<br/><br/>Players take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.<br/><br/>The currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).<br/><br/>Once activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed. Naval and air units pack a greater punch, but don&rsquo;t bounce back from damage as easily.<br/><br/>Scenarios, or game situations, begin the game in 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 or 1945. Political markers are randomly chosen to determine what events might take place outside the players&rsquo; control: Poland might capitulate to Germany in 1939, Mussolini, Churchill or Hitler might unleash some stupid scheme the Italian, British or German player will have to execute, oil could be found in Libya, the French navy could rally to the Allies or the Axis, jets can be developed, good Germans might kill Hitler &mdash; dozens of such events are possible.<br/><br/><br/>As one of the most popular games of all time, our edition of Third Reich has also spawned a sequel, Great Pacific War. The two games can be played together or separately.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Avalanche Press' re-release of the original classic. This is a significant overhaul based on the Avalon Hill Third Reich, and has nothing to do with the later Advanced Third Reich.<br/><br/>There has been dramatic simplification and streamlining, however. Gone is the CRT, replaced by a Columbia-esque &quot;roll lots of dice&quot; combat resolution system. The whole front/option system has been revised with an &quot;HQ activation marker&quot; system: each nation buys activation markers for HQs, land, and air units, and puts them in a cup. Turn order is then determined by draws. Naval and air systems have been overhauled and simplified: sea zones now regulate movement. Tactical air support is now limited to being equal to the strength of the attacker/defender, not three times.<br/><br/>Also includes 1938 (Spanish Civil War boils over to a general European conflict) and 1945 scenarios (Western Allies and Russia fall out after collapse of Germany).<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Dinosaur cards have values ranging from 1-5 while Escape cards have values ranging from +1 to +3.  In order to play a Dinosaur atop another Dinosaur, it must be greater in value than the preceding card.  Escape cards may be played on any Dinosaur and these also allow you to play an additional Dinosaur card.<br/><br/>Once someone has gone out, movement on the board (of players and the Spinosaurus) is based upon the last played card.<br/><br/>If the Spinosaurus lands on your pawn, you are knocked back (not eliminated).<br/><br/>First pawn/player to reach the Final Escape space wins.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

If you play your cards right, you'll be backing the winners and score thanks to their efforts.<br/><br/>Dice Run includes thirty dice, with six dice in each of five different colors. To start the game, you roll these dice on the table to form the starting pack of runners. Each player has a hand of three movement cards and four secret target cards; these latter cards show a die with a particular number and color.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player plays a movement card and carries out its effect. If he chooses a red movement card, for example, all of the red dice &quot;break out&quot; of the pack and move ahead to form the leading group of runners. If the next player plays a 5 movement card, she first moves ahead all of the 5s from the leading group &ndash; thereby forming a new leading group &ndash; then she moves all the 5s from the next group in line ahead one group. Movement cards also allow players to switch the position of two non-leading groups, to drop a die from the leading group to the back of the pack, to flip all the dice in a group that match a particular number, to have three dice break out from the leading group, and so on. Alternatively, a player can place a movement card face down on the table, then roll all the dice in a non-leading group; he can't take this option again until another player makes such a roll. After playing a card, he refills his hand to three movement cards.<br/><br/>A player can also choose to use one of his secret target cards to move the dice, first moving all the dice of the matching number, then all dice of the matching color, or vice versa. This card remains on the table.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the movement deck is seeded with four stage cards valued 3-6. When a stage card is revealed, players each simultaneously reveal one of their secret target cards. (If a player used a target card for movement, he must choose this card.) For each die in the leading group that matches the color of this card, the player scores 1 point; he also scores 1 point for each matching number. If a die is identical to his target card, he scores 1 bonus point as well. Whoever has the highest score claims the stage card, which is worth 3-6 stage points. The players with the second- and third-highest scores receive 2 and 1 stage point.<br/><br/>After four stages, the player with the most stage points wins!<br/><br/>",2002,,,

And very good for it, it is too. There are 121 tiles with 1-6 dots like a standard die or domino (20 of each number plus an extra 1). Players alternately draw and place 2 tiles on the board extending the pattern already laid. When you make a vertical or horizontal line that totals 10, 11 or 12 (12 is the limit), you score 1, 2 or 4 points accordingly on your game pad. Completing scoring lines on the pad gives a rising bonus and covering marked squares on the board gives you a doubling bonuses on your pad.<br/><br/>Simple and quick, but surprisingly challenging when you get the idea. The idea being that you must keep an even, balanced score pad, scoring 10s and 11s, not just successive 12s. Easy to pick up, but it requires some effort to score well; spotting those opportunities to place one tile which scores each way, making sure you keep clocking up 10s, to turn into 11s or 12s. Luck does play a role, but good players consistently score highly game after game, so there must be something deeper at work.<br/>The publisher Perner maintains a website with play &amp; chat over the internet and there are several very active Zatre clubs in Germany, Austria &amp; Switzerland.

All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them.

If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck; if you're wrong, you pay the other players one card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered.

Cards may touch at corners, and the corner of one card may touch the side of another.<br/><br/>Players advance by purchasing stores formed by the cards and collecting revenue from those stores at the beginning of each subsequent turn. Symbols on cards may trigger effects when drawn, either destroying or emptying the largest store, or giving players bonus payouts.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by the first player to reach 50 points.<br/><br/>Since revenue comes from the quality of your store, but other players can play tiles to alter that store, the overall result is a cutthroat mind-bender, making it one of the most popular games of Cheapass's Hip Pocket Games series.

The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.<br/><br/>Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!<br/><br/>The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.<br/><br/>Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.<br/><br/>Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).<br/><br/>There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).<br/><br/>Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.<br/><br/>At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings.

Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.<br/>Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.<br/>The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. <br/>Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.<br/><br/>Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.<br/><br/>",1993,,,

2997,Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide,"['Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Age of Reason', 'Wargame']","From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>The Seven Years' War Worldwide<br/><br/>Between 1756 and 1763, Europe erupted into what became the first true world-wide conflict, known as the Seven Years&rsquo; War. On the one hand, Britain and France vied for supremacy in world-wide trade, becoming deadly enemies in the process. On the other, Austria and Prussia struggled for dominance in Germany. On the fringes, Russia began to feel her growing power, while Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey all knew their time was almost up.<br/><br/>Soldier Kings re-creates the free-for-all that was the Seven Years&rsquo; War. Two to eight players take the roles of the nations listed above, trying to capture or hold onto the rich lands of Europe, India, South-East Asia and America. The world is changing; the power that grabs the most now will dominate the modern age that is just dawning. If you&rsquo;re the Soldier King, that power will be you.<br/><br/>In Soldier Kings, each player has armies and fleets. There are also a handful of generals and admirals to assist these in battle and in movement. The best is Frederick of Prussia, called &ldquo;The Great&rdquo; for a reason. The worst is the hapless Prince of Orange, with whom the Dutch player is saddled.<br/><br/>Players have allies; some are set at the beginning of the game, others alliances are forged during the course of play. Everyone else is an enemy. No one is &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;; those are just enemies you haven&rsquo;t attacked yet.<br/><br/>The map is divided into land areas and sea zones. Armies move on land, fleets at sea. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for your forces, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Money is, well, money. You expend manpower to rebuild your forces, and money to finance their actions. Thus you need to hang on to areas that generate these resources for you, and take them from the other guy.<br/><br/>You do that by defeating enemy armies, and besieging enemy areas. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor. These hits must be sustained by enemy armies by reducing them in strength, or eliminating them. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there). The procedure here is very similar.<br/><br/>Throwing a twist into all of this is card play. The universe is loaded with random elements; life does not unfold as an orderly series of &ldquo;phases.&rdquo; After a short countdown to start the game, players can play cards at any time, in any order.<br/><br/>The cards are the centerpiece of the game, giving it its free-wheeling nature. Generals can vacillate. Mercenaries can be hired. Local militia can appear to help. Soldiers might run off to loot. Bridges get burned, snow falls early, the harvests are bad, the harvests are good. Royal marriages, minor country alliances, the rise of new leaders &mdash; all sorts of events take place during card play.<br/><br/>The game contains seven scenarios: a campaign game covering the entire war, and then six shorter ones, one for each year of the war. Play ends on a pre-determined turn or when a player has achieved his or her conditions for automatic victory, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Across this vast expanse, players maneuver a colorful array of combat units representing various White factions, Anarchists, Nationalists, Alied Intervention Forces, the two divisions of the Czech Legion, and six Polish armies.<br/><br/>Units range from armies to brigades. The Red Order of Battle is built around 16 Red Armies organized by Leon Trotsky. There are also two powerful Red cavalry armies and the elite Latvian Rifle division. The White Order of Battle includes everything from Cossack cavalry corps to Muslim partisans and a German Free Corps. Each side also has support units: naval and river flotillas, air units, and, of course, the famous armored trains. Key leaders are also included: Frunze, Denikin, Wrangel, and Trotsky and his famous Red Train.<br/><br/>To model the chaos of this many-sided multi-front war, the sequence of play is based upon random chit pull which determines the order of activation of each White faction or six Red Army Front commands. The key Logistics phase, in which disrupted units are rallied and unsupplied units attritted, is also randomly determined. The game also includes TWO random event tables: one for each side.<br/>From sweeping cavalry advances to slogging matches over major cities (such as Tsaritsyn - the future Stalingrad - know as the Red Verdun), Reds! is a true player's game.

Each player on their turn draws, rolls their dice, and places one of them in the dice tray. Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.<br/><br/>Game 2<br/><br/>Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.<br/><br/>Game 3<br/><br/>All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.<br/><br/>After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.<br/><br/>The game ends when the dice tray is full. The winner is the player with the highest total score.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

The fielding player sets the field, the board showing concentric circles around the wicket divided into segments, selects Pace or Spin for the over and spins the delivery, eg. Good Length, Long Hop, Bouncer/Googly. Upon seeing the field and the delivery, the batting player declares a stroke, eg Cut, Cover Drive, Pull, Hook, Leg Glance. There are 12 strokes and an avoiding action if a bouncer is bowled. A card is drawn and the result determined. Initially, the delivery may defeat the batsman, so if a Cut was played, the card might read Bowled if Yorker, whereas a Straight Drive gets an LBW if Good Length. If the bowler wasn't out, the next column shows the segment the ball was struck to. If there is no fielder there, the runs are scored from the card, 0 to 4 with a very rare 6. But if there is a fielder present no runs are scored, and if the card is also marked catch, a catch is possible. This is determined by another spinner, but the higher order get 3 and 2 lives, the tail are out first time. Normal cricket rules apply and the game has advanced rules for bowling &amp; fielding variants.<br/>Sumo has the original publisher as A W Compton producing a limited 200 edition. The set I have is by RDA Marketing and Luding reckons the designer is Richard Pullen. Although my rules set refers to a card dispenser and a window display, the game doesn't have them.

The Guard troopers began to ride around the town on both sides, threatening a double envelopment. Observing this, the Nassauers started to withdraw back up the road toward Waterloo.<br/><br/>The Guard Chasseurs Regiment, 1100 men under the command of General Francois Lallemand, pursued them off the road into the woods of Bossu, capturing 15 men.<br/>At the same time, the 800 Lancers of the Guard continued straight for Quatre-Bras itself. Their commander, General Colbert de la Chabanais, rode behind with a small escort, into the walled-farm of Genioncourt.<br/><br/>By pre-arranged signal, the 2600 troops of the 2nd Nassau Regiment, who remained in Quatre-Bras, set fire to a beacon and fired their 8 guns, alerting the rest of the Anglo-Allied army further up the road, toward Waterloo. As the Lancers approached the crossroads, the two Nassau regiments in the town and in the woods on their flank kept up a fire of musketry which made it impossible for them to remain in their exposed position on the open road.<br/><br/>Had the Lancers succeeded in hustling the Duke's Nassau troops from Quatre-Bras as they had done in at Frasnes, the battle to be fought there the next day would have been a defensive one for the French.

During a turn a player moves one of his or her ships along the the spiral exactly the number on the die.  A player can choose to change the number on a die up or down by one instead of moving.<br/><br/>The game revolves around attempting to land on other ships (friendly or otherwise) which allows sliding down at least one loop of spiral until it reaches an unoccupied spot, thus cutting out a lot of transit time.  When this happens, the die is rolled before it is placed in its landing spot to receive a new number. Typically, long chains are formed which can be taken advantage of by all players. Knowing when to form, break, take advantage of, and foil the use of these chains is the key to winning.<br/><br/>In the three-player version, the first player to get 4 of their 6 ships out wins.

3058,Schaumermal,[],['Sports'],"Schaumermal is a board game aimed at simulating a federation football (henceafter simply called football) match.  Each player manages a team of 11 players (10 players and a goalkeeper) on a rectangular board with the lines of a football pitch printed on it and overlaid with a grid.<br/><br/>In a regular game, the two players set up their teams (of 10 players and a goalkeeper) in their halves.  One side is nominated the home team (the other, the away team) and starts off the game.  The game is played in turns.  During each turn, the team in possession of the ball passes or kicks the ball, and moves 3 players.  The opposing team then moves 3 of its players to interfere with the other's play.  Different playing positions of the team (e.g. striker, dribblers, etc) move differently.<br/><br/>The aim of the team in possession of the ball is to put the ball into the net of the opposing team (thus scoring a goal), and its opponent aims to stop it from doing so by blocking the paths towards goal and tackling opposing players to gain possession of the ball.  Whether a ball is kicked accurately to its target location or how much it deviated off-course is determined by the roll of a die.  The results of tackles are determined by comparing dice rolls.<br/><br/>The game lasts until a pre-determined time elapses (in which case the team who has scored the most goals wins) or a team has scored a pre-determined number of goals (and wins).  The game includes rules for variants such as Hocus Pocus cards that allow players to change the events of play, customization of each individual player (introducing ability points and skills), and league play.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

The artwork features characters from the movie &quot;Shogun&quot;, and the game can be played in a simple (beginner) or an advanced version, which makes use of all the cards.<br/><br/>There are two &quot;colors&quot; of cards, peasants and samurai, which are organized into several subclasses like Farmer, Servant, Samurai Wife, or Hatamoto, which all have different point values. Basically, you try to score points by getting either a complete hand of one color (but no doubles), or several cards of the same type. Furthermore, there are wild cards like the Priest, the Emperor, the Heir and of course the Shogun which all have special values in certain combinations. Several other cards like a joker (the &quot;Buddha&quot;) or an elimination card (the &quot;Ninja&quot;) are also part of the deck. Unlike many other card games, you don't hold the cards in your hand; four of your five cards are displayed face up in front of you, while the fifth lies face down to be kept secret till the end of the turn. This makes bluffing as important a factor as luck and strategy in this game.<br/><br/>But that's not all. Right before the end (and before revealing their face-down card), players can choose a final strategy, represented by small strategy markers. &quot;Passive&quot; means you get the points your hand is worth (if any), while &quot;Power Play&quot; can double your score (or even turn a zero point hand into 20 points), but only if either you're the only one to play &quot;Power Play&quot;, or if you're the player with the highest score this round. For every other &quot;Power Player&quot; there's a hefty point penalty.<br/><br/>There are even more special cards that I won't go into detail about (such as the &quot;Spy&quot; or the &quot;Hostage&quot;), as well as an intricate turn sequence that allows players to play their cards almost simultaneously. Also, the deck is only reshuffled when all the cards have been used up, which may take a few rounds and will make sure that certain powerful cards only show up ever so often, and not always in the right order to be played.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy part of this game is it's unique atmosphere. The rules successfully impose a courteous oriental gameplay where cards aren't simply dealt, but offered, and where Favors can be used to influence a hand. At the same time, there's always the shadow of the Ninja looming over the table, and even though it rarely strikes, it can re-arrange the whole score sheet.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has reached 500 points (or 1,000 points for &quot;epic games&quot;).

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &ndash; The Nobles.

But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.<br/><br/>History<br/>The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.<br/><br/>The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.<br/>Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.<br/><br/>What's in the box?<br/>Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at <a target='_blank' href=""http://www.gangoffour.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer noopener"">www.gangoffour.com</a><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Inspired by Big Two<br/><br/>",1990,,,

One hour turns.<br/><br/>27 Confederate counters<br/>41 Union counters<br/><br/>Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).<br/><br/>Roberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.<br/><br/>The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.<br/><br/>The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.<br/><br/>The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.<br/><br/>Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).<br/><br/>",1958,,,

3102,Banque Fatale,"['Auction/Bidding', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Open Drafting']",['Economic'],"In Banque Fatale, players bid with colored chips for cards (called Card Fatales) which show an Ace or Aces in the 5 colors. The value of the colors start at 6 million and rise and fall according to the total chips played. So if 2+ Blue chips are bid, Blue rises by 2 million. But if only one Blue chip was bid, Blue falls by 1 million and if no Blue chips were bid, Blue falls by 2 million. If a color reaches 11 or 12, there is a pay-out for each Ace of that color you own, 5 or 6 million, and it is reset to 6 million.<br/><br/>Then the bid chips are taken back one by one, starting with the player to the left of the auction winner. So if you didn't bid at all, you'll be taking chips from high bidders.<br/><br/>Finally, then the starting player can sell a Card Fatale to the bank at its value or values (not one that has just increased). The player clockwise to the starting player is now the starting player. When the deck of 16 cards runs out, cards held are cashed out, chips still held are worth 1 million each (variant suggests they are worth nil) and the most cash wins.<br/><br/>It isn't clear if players should hide the cards they own, or if it should be an open knowledge game, which would greatly affect the dynamic.

3128,Clippers,['Network and Route Building'],"['Economic', 'Nautical']","Remade and re-themed Santa Fe. Players own trading settlements on islands in the Pacific and must attempt to get trade routes established in order to make those settlements score points. Trade routes are established by connecting various different shipping companies, represented by different colored Clippers, to land at your island. The more Clippers that land at an island, the more points a settlement there will be worth.<br/><br/>Players control creation of trade routes by six trading companies by laying down wooden sticks that advance the appropriate clipper. The different islands have point values, as well as a set amount of potential settlements and a number of ports that clippers can land at. Throughout the game phases, players will have to manage placing their settlements, claiming option cards, laying track segments, and adding new clippers. With no luck involved, it is a difficult task to both advance the clippers in the way you want without alerting your opponents to your plans. Successful play heavily involves taking advantage of situations your opponents leave open and capitalizing on ports that they make valuable.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, an island will be worth its value multiplied by the number of different companies that have landed at it. Duplicate landings by the same company do not increase the score. For every settlement you have on an island, you will score points. For instance, an island with a base value of 5 that has 3 different companies will be worth 15 points. If you have placed 2 settlements there, it will earn you 30 points. Place your ports too early and no one will send ships there; place them too late and you may not get a spot!<br/><br/>",2002,,,

One thing to do on your turn is &quot;explore,&quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.

Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.<br/><br/>The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.<br/><br/>Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.<br/><br/>If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play.

3157,All Star Baseball,"['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']",['Sports'],"Designed by former major league player Ethan Allen and introduced in 1941, All-Star Baseball became one of the most popular sports games of all time.  The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter's result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.  Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard.  Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.<br/><br/>",1941,,,

The players represent the owners and jockeys of the horses in the race and the people betting on the race.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player is given a certain amount of cash. This money is used to bid on horses. Each horse is represented by an &quot;Ownership Card&quot; which shows the horse's name, stable and &quot;Speed&quot;. Speed is used to determine the likelihood of gaining an &quot;Advantage&quot; during the race. Bidding for each horse lasts three rounds and the high bidder gets the horse.<br/><br/>Once the horses have been assigned their starting positions are determined and the Ownership Cards are placed in the &quot;Readout Machine&quot;. This is a tray which holds the cards and will be used to determine movement. After all the horses are in the tray &quot;Odds Cards&quot; are placed below each Ownership Card. Odds Cards will determine the actual movement of each horse.<br/><br/>Players may now make wagers on any horse they choose. Wagers may be made on any number of horses and may be made for Win, Place or Show. The player records their bets on a &quot;Betting Slip&quot; and places it face down on the board, then pays the total amount of the bets.<br/><br/>To run the race the spinner is used to generate a random number. This number is used on the Readout Machine to determine the number of spaces moved and the &quot;Diagonal Allowance&quot; for each horse. Each Odds card has a column of numbers for total movement and a second column for Diagonal allowance. The Diagonal Allowance is the number of diagonal moves the horse may make and is therefore the number of times the horse can change lanes. The horse must use all of its movement but does not have to use all of its allowed lane changes.  The spinner's random number determines which row of numbers on the Odds cards will be used in the current round for moving the horses along the track.<br/><br/>Sometimes the spinner will indicate &quot;Advantage&quot;. When this happens an Advantage card is drawn. Advantage Cards each show the name of one horse and that horse is allowed a free move of 6 with a diagonal allowance of 2. Other horses may not move. The better a horse's speed, the more Advantage Cards that horse has in the deck.<br/><br/>The race continues until all of the horses have crossed the finish line. If more than one horse crosses the line in the same turn the horse which moves the furtherest past the finish line is the winner. The second and third place horse is determined the same way.<br/><br/>Once all the horses have crossed the finish line the betting slips are revealed and winning wagers are paid. The players then set up the horses and the Readout Machine for the next race. Ownership of the horses remains the same but the starting order and Odds Cards change.<br/><br/>A total of six races are run. The player with the most cash at the end of all six races is the winner.<br/><br/>This is a very good game. Players can spend a good deal of money buying the best horses at the start of the game, but they then have less cash to place bets with. Meanwhile, other players can bet on their horses anyway. Also, the randomness of the appearance of the Advantage Cards mean that a good horse can have a bad showing and the slowest horse may come from behind to win. There is nothing to prevent a player from betting on another horse and racing theirs badly to influence the outcome but the other players may be doing the same thing and the fact that six races are run means that no one is likely to try it more than once (though it may show up as a race 6 strategy).

3219,Demonworld,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","Demonworld is a hybrid miniatures and hex style wargame. The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.<br/><br/>As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   <br/>The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.<br/><br/>Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.<br/><br/>Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.<br/><br/>Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",1999,,,

This is a game of Grand Strategy with each player assuming the role of an Admiral of the Fleet and trying to control the sea areas that are important to his nation&rsquo;s interests. The rules are easy to learn, and yet require cunning strategies to achieve ultimate victory. An ideal wargame for beginner&rsquo;s, Victory at Sea also serves as a fast-playing, tense contest for experience gamers.<br/><br/>The Allied player, although possessing a mighty armada of English and American ships, faces a difficult task. The Kreigsmarine&rsquo;s powerful battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz present a formidable threat. Control of the Mediterranean must be wrested from an elusive Italian fleet. Vital convoys have to be protected from stalking U-Boats and audacious German surface raiders. Oilers in the Atlantic allow ships such as the Graf Spee to elude pursuit whilst harassing Allied vessels. The Axis player has a small fleet by comparison to the Allies, but a shrewd strategy can exhaust hsi opponent and win the war.<br/><br/>Victory at Sea allows you to recreate every major aspect of the naval war. The game mechanics include Admirals, port repair facilities, the invasion of France, U-Boat technology, surface raiders &amp; oilers, the British Home Fleet, critical hits &amp; damage control, limited intelligence, airpower, mines, and convoys.

The Battle of the Bulge&quot; is a card wargame for 2-4 players recreating the famous World War II battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)<br/><br/>The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)<br/><br/>",1998,,,

3267,Magelaen,['Auction/Bidding'],"['Exploration', 'Renaissance']","Players are kings (or queens) bidding for the services of six famous explorers -- Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Francisco Pizarro, Vasco da Gama, James Cook, and Marco Polo. As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.<br/><br/>Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.<br/><br/>A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.<br/><br/>Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.<br/><br/>Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

The game has been designed with the fun strategy player in mind. Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>The game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!<br/><br/>",2002,,,

The game was meant to target an audience of those that felt Pokemon was too much a kids game, but not ready to jump into the highly competitive (and 'older' target audience) of Magic: The Gathering.

But victory did not come cheap. <br/>After showing the British the color of their mettle at Bunker Hill, Washington's little army was plagued by one defeat after another, shunting from one battlefield to the next; always beaten but never destroyed. No power of the period believed that the upstart colonials and their unborn nation had the slightest chance of emerging victorious against the strongest military machine of the era after the dismal summer of 1776. But then came the cruelest winter of the decade when even nature seemed to join forces with the British against the tattered American troops. Undaunted, Washington led his small force in the historic crossing of the Delaware to twice surprise and rout British forces at Trenton and Princeton. Their resolve thus strengthened, the ill-clad Americans retired to Valley Forge to face winter beset by the hunger and deprivation that cost the lives of 2500 patriots. But the coming spring found Clinton facing a revitalized and strengthened rebel army which proceeded to chase him across New Jersey in the Monmouth Campaign.

There are action cards, including a sack of lies which has no value and so you must lie when playing it.<br/><br/>Playing Scheinheilig your goal is to get rid of the cards in your hand.<br/>In total, there are 70 cards numbered evenly from 1 to 10, 26 Angels (Jokers), 8 Devils (don&acute;t want those) and 8 &quot;skip a turn&quot;-cards. Every player starts the game with 10 cards and play proceeds clockwise.<br/>The youngest player starts and has to discard cards with the number &quot;1&quot; face down. At least he has to pretend to discarded 1&acute;s. A player can put down any number of cards. The next player can then either accept whatever was just discarded and discard 2&acute;s on his own or he can question one of the cards just discarded and turn it face up. If he was right and card does not show the correct number, the player who tried to discard a wrong card has to take back the questioned card and all cards on top of it. On top of that he has to roll the die and draw that many cards from the deck. If the questioned card had the correct number, the questioning player has to roll the die and draw that many cards. Angels are always considered the correct number, Devils never. Whenever it is your turn, you can also just draw a card and end your turn. Whoever gets rid of all cards first, wins.<br/><br/>",1978,,,

The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.<br/><br/>The basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.<br/><br/>Attacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.<br/><br/>A basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>",2002,,,

The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!<br/><br/>The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.<br/><br/>There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.<br/><br/>Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games.

He compares it to the perpetrator-card.<br/>If one the features (old/young/man/woman/poison/dagger/gun/blue/green/yellow/brown) matches the perpetrator-card he says that the person on that card is suspicious. If none of the features match he says that the person on the card is innocent.<br/>This continues until a player thinks he knows who is the perpetrator. If the accuser is wrong, he may not guess again until another player succesfully accuses the right perpetrator. This player scores 1 point.<br/>Now the next player shuffles the cards and picks a perpetrator and a new round starts. If all players started a new round, the game ends and the player with most points wins. In case of a tie, one additional round is played with the tied players.<br/><br/>Players take turn calling and the winner is the best detective.<br/><br/>",1989,,,

3353,De Barbarossa a Berlín,"['Action/Event', 'Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Simulation']","['Wargame', 'World War II']","(from GMT Games:)<br/><br/>Spring 1941: Nazi Germany is triumphant. Poland has long since vanished from the map. Denmark, Norway, and the Low Countries have been overrun. France, the victor of 1918, has fallen. Greece and Yugoslavia have now been crushed. Britain stands alone, freed from the threat of invasion by the courage and skill of its air force and navy. But Britain is stalked and assaulted by the Nazi wolfpacks, and in North Africa a mixed garrison of British and Commonwealth forces is besieged in Tobruk by Rommel and his Afrika Korps.<br/><br/>Then, on June 22, Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Stalin's Soviet Union. As the panzer spearheads slice through the bewildered Russian defenders, it appears that nothing can halt the Nazi tide. But the course of History has just taken a major turn. The Last European War is over; World War II has begun. It will end four years later, in a bunker in the ruins of Berlin.<br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin covers those four years of epic struggle, from Moscow to Stalingrad, from Tobruk to Tunis, from Sicily to Rome, from D-Day to the Rhine, to the final battles for the Reich. Designed by Ted Raicer as a follow-up to his award-winning WWI strategic game, Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin modifies the Paths of Glory systems to capture the strategic and operational dynamics of WWII in Europe.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin uses a point to point map, this time covering all of Europe from France to the Urals, and from Norway to North Africa. Units are armies and corps (fronts and armies for the Soviets), and each turn represents three months. The movement and combat systems will be familiar to Paths of Glory players, but have been modified to recreate the blitzkrieg campaigns of 1941-45.<br/><br/>As in Paths of Glory, the heart of the game lies in the 110 Action Cards (55 each for the Axis and Allied players). Each card can be used for operational movement and combat, strategic movement, replacements, or for an Event. Events include:<br/><br/><br/>    Individual leaders (Patton, Guderian, or Rommel the Desert Fox) <br/>    Tactical innovations and new weapons (Fortified boxes, Tiger tanks) <br/>    Strategic Warfare (U-boats, Bomber Command, the 8th Airforce) <br/>    Reinforcements (Soviet Mechanized Fronts, PanzerArmee Afrika, Patton's Third Army) <br/>    Allied Invasions, actual or potential (Torch, Sledgehammer, Husky, Overlord) <br/>    Politics and Diplomacy (Hitler Declares War, Casablanca, Yalta, Operation Axis) <br/>    Irregular Warfare (Partisans, the Maquis, Otto Skorzeny)<br/><br/><br/>World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin presents both the Allied and Axis players with a wide range of exciting game choices, while illustrating the key historical factors of the war; from the importance of mechanized forces in combat to the importance of oil to fuel them, but without the complexity of other strategic WWII designs. And unlike many of those games, World War II: Barbarossa to Berlin lives up to its title: an Axis player who fails to win the war may still win the game. The winner is often decided on the last turn as the Allied player struggles to extinguish the last traces of the Nazi empire.<br/><br/>It is June 22, 1941: Will WWII end in German triumph in Barbarossa or collapse in Berlin? As the world holds its breath, the decisions are yours.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Once a word is in front of someone, other players may steal it by making an anagram of it which introduces other letters from the pool.<br/><br/>Reimplemented as Snatch and Scrabble Scoring Anagrams. Published during the same time frame as the 1877 Word Making and Taking. A version of this game using the word &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; in its title was published by Thomas Whittaker in New York on or before 1875 and was called &ldquo;The Game of Anagrams&rdquo;. With Parker Brothers and McLoughlin Brothers both releasing Anagrams games in 1890, this likely reflects the expiry of the 14 year patent period that existed at the time.<br/><br/><br/>Many editions of the game have been sold and exact rules vary, but one version runs as follows:<br/><br/>The players shuffle the letters in the &quot;pool&quot; thoroughly. Each player, in turn, draws a letter tile from the pool and places it face up on the table. These letters are available to all players on their turn.<br/><br/>Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.<br/><br/>Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.<br/><br/>If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.<br/><br/>When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in &quot;stealing&quot; may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.<br/><br/>Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to &quot;steal&quot; a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in &quot;stealing&quot; a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.<br/><br/>Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.<br/><br/>When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters. Each player counts the number of tiles in all of the words he has formed in front of him.<br/><br/>The winner is the person who has first obtained eight (8) words. The game is not over until ALL players have had an EQUAL number of turns.<br/><br/>If at the end of an equal number of turns there is more than one player with eight (8) words, count the number of tiles in those 8 words. The player with the most tiles wins. If the number of tiles in the 8 words is equal, then the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>",1875,,,

She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum &le; 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum &le; 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.<br/><br/>If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll. When a piece in the middle of a stack moves, it leaves all pieces below it in place.<br/><br/>When a piece or a stack lands on or passes the final space in the lap, the owner of the topmost piece takes one of the prize cards; each prize has a value on it, and once all the prizes have been claimed, whoever has the highest sum of prize cards wins.<br/><br/>The 2014 edition of the game, Mah&eacute;, allows for play with up to seven player turtles, who are circling the island while trying to lay their eggs on the beach and receive points for doing a good job.<br/><br/>",1974,,,

It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The battles included in this game are:<br/><br/>Edgehill, 23 October 1642<br/>    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/>First Newbury, 20 September 1643<br/>    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.<br/><br/>Marston Moor, 2 July 1644<br/>    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.<br/><br/>Second Newbury, 27 October 1644<br/>    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/>Naseby, 14 June 1645<br/>    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes.

Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

The German General Staff had prepared the Schlieffen Master Plan of a giant right hook into France which its namesake had hoped would result in a Cannae-like battle of annihilation of France. The French believing that an attack would always win and that elan would carry the day, prepared to assault the lightly held German lines in Alsalce-Lorraine.<br/><br/>Both plans failed.<br/><br/>Drive on Paris allows both sides to execute the historical campaigns or variations on them and are rated for victory on how well their operation succeeds.

3412,Brandywine,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Age of Reason', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame']","An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.<br/><br/>General George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.<br/><br/>Thus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end. One bold stroke will free the land.&quot;<br/><br/>",2000,,,
3413,Saratoga,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Age of Reason', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame']","In all the spectacle of war there has seldom been a sight the equal of British General Burgoyne's campaign of 1777. The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.<br/><br/>The intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.<br/><br/>The fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;<br/><br/>It's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?<br/><br/>As the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?<br/><br/>These are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.<br/><br/>",1998,,,

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.<br/><br/>Fallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.<br/><br/>In the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.<br/><br/>The player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win.

A player passes the dice when he wishes, but if he rolls one or two skunks, points rolled during that turn are ignored and penalties (in the form of discarding some of their poker chips) are enforced.  First player to achieve 100 points (or higher) wins that round, and play continues for as long players wish.  The winner is whoever has the most chips to his name (in typical poker values of 1, 5, and 10).

Three complete games are included: Sicily-Invade and capture Italy's southern island fortress, Normandy Breakout-Direct the critical campaign on the sweep to Berlin, and Battle of the Bulge-The daring breakthrough to Bastogne.  A two-sided (19&quot; x 26&quot;) game board is provided.<br/><br/>The game maps are historically accurate, as well as the initial troop deployments. Troop movement per turn is dictated by 24 troop movement cards. Allied and German units are 112 die cut cardboard pieces. Battles are resolved using 5 red and 5 white battle dice.<br/><br/>The game plays very well for a wargame of its age. The troop movement card deck works better than one might think. Moving the little cardboard counters is typical of wargames of this era. And the battle resolution based upon rolling multiples of any number seems unbalanced at first, but after a few plays you realize that it too works as well as the troop movement card deck.  Two very innovative wargaming mechanisms that allow for quick movement and battle resolution.

Also, you may steal other players&rsquo; cattle by stepping on their ranches. If you do so, you will have to reach town without being captured by the player you stole cattle from. Players, if their cattle is stolen, can chase thieves not only through ordinary routes, but also through cutaways, however if he will use them, he could lose ability to step on his ranches and take cattle to town for sell.

Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.<br/><br/>Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.<br/><br/>The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.<br/><br/>In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more.

Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).<br/><br/>Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.<br/><br/>In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents.

The game has been copied by many companies since and is the most widely available of all 3D Chess boards.<br/><br/>The most famous variant of 3D Chess appeared in the Star Trek television show in 1966, in which it was referred to as 'Three Dimensional Chess'.<br/>The original stage property was designed by Irving A Feinberg and consisted of three 4x4 boards and four movable 2x2 boards.<br/>It was developed into a real game by the technical designer Franz Joseph Schnaubelt in his 1975 book, the Star Fleet Technical Manual and improved by a fan and chess player Andrew Bartmess, whose rules are some of the most popular.<br/>Fans of Star Trek still call it 'Three Dimensional Chess' but players of the game call it by the title Schnaubelt popularised 'Tri Dimensional Chess'.<br/><br/>In 1985, the game design Gary Gygax published rules for Dragon Chess in Dragon magazine.<br/>A Dragon Chess board is three 8x12 boards stacked up and includes the extra pieces: Sylph, Griffon, Dragon, Warrior, Oliphant, Unicorn, Hero, Thief, Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Dwarf, Basilisk and Elemental.<br/><br/>Max Chappell started designing Hyperchess in the early '70s but didn't produce and sell the first commercial set until 1996.<br/>Although it was influenced by the tri dimensional chess board, it has been described as more helical in design.<br/><br/>In 2001 William d'Agostino recreated the Strato Chess board and called it Millenium Chess, with the idea of extending Classic Chess, whithout distorting the game.<br/><br/>",1851,,,
3500,Les Flibustiers,"['Roll / Spin and Move', 'Set Collection']",['Memory'],"The game consists of a board, showing 30 different types of contraband goods, Gold, Cigarettes etc, each marked by a small picture and it's name. Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.<br/><br/>The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.<br/>(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)<br/><br/>",1992,,,

The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.<br/><br/>Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.<br/><br/>This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch<br/><br/>The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.<br/>The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.<br/><br/>",1997,,,

Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.<br/>A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.<br/>Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!<br/><br/>",1973,,,
3572,Invasion: America – Death Throes of the Superpower,"['Hexagon Grid', 'Zone of Control']","['Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']","Invasion: America is a &quot;mini-monster&quot; wargame designed by Jim Dunnigan and published by SPI in 1976. It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.<br/><br/>There are 400 (7 are blank) 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's &quot;untried&quot; status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.<br/><br/>On each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.<br/><br/>Invasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.<br/><br/>Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.<br/><br/>",1976,,,

3584,World War 3: 1976-1984,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Modern Warfare', 'Wargame']","World War 3- 1976-1984, is a simulation on an army/fleet level scale of a hypothetical, world-wide, conventional conflict at the height of the cold war (1976-1984). The simulation is primarily of land and naval conflict with the secondary influence of air forces. The game covers five years in seasonal (quarterly) turns. Optional rules allow Players to choose from several levels of complexity.<br/><br/>With the increased number of small scale conflicts throughout the world had come increased tension and strain in relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States. Each superpower felt it necessary to choose sides in the local, &quot;conventional&quot; wars that proliferated in the late 1970's, until each felt small pressures from all directions. Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Asian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America were involved to various degrees, in conflict.<br/><br/>Then, one side (we're not saying which) began to feel its position slipping, as its favored side in war after war became threatened, with the scale of the conflicts ever more violent. Warnings and violent talk were followed by the commitment of the first conventional land forces by a superpower. This was followed immediately by an even greater commitment from the other side, and the war of escalation was on.<br/><br/>The Soviet Union struck first in Europe, and overran Germany and France in a matter of weeks. Italy and the smaller countries of Western Europe were cowed into submission, and Leftist regimes came to power in each of them. However, with the larger Gross National Product, and thus, with the larger capacity to make war, the United States was in a better position to wage a prolonged war. The United States struck back in outlying areas, consolidating its gains in areas that, without a sufficient fleet, the Soviet Union could not maintain proper contact with. <br/>Of course, the question of decisive victory was quite impossible. Because the war had &quot;crept up&quot; upon the superpowers, there had been no nuclear exchange, and, so far, the threats to resort to nuclear warfare had remained unfulfilled. But, if either power should become directly threatened, the possibility that it would use nuclear weapons would become a near-certainty. Thus, both sides kept their military goals small. The United States hoped to use its greater war making capacity to wear down its opponent, while the Soviet Union attempted to use its overwhelming strength to achieve lightning victories in short campaigns.<br/><br/>As the futility of the war became apparent, and the populations and their economies began to show signs of fatigue, the war gradually wound down to a sort of &quot;cold war&quot; stalemate, and, although there were thousands of miles of front lines, the unofficial orders of the frontline troops were not to provoke the enemy. And because of this unsatisfactory, but inevitable resolution, the responsible parties in the governments of both superpowers were overthrown, allowing for a gradual withdrawal of troops from the battlefields across the globe.<br/><br/>This game is a simulation of a hypothetical conflict. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the entire world. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units which might take part in such a conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the units involved are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game &mdash; just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>World War 3 is basically a two-Player game (an Optional Rule provides for an independent Red Chinese command). Each Player moves his units and executes attacks on Enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the conditions .of victory. To move from one hex to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. Naval Transport and Amphibious Movement allows the transfer of land units across bodies of water. Combat is resolved by comparing the Combat Strength Points of opposing units and expressing the comparison as a difference (differential) between Attacker and Defender. A die is rolled and the outcome indicated on the appropriate (Land or Naval) Combat Results Table is applied to the units involved.<br/><br/>Rules and map are similar to Dunnigan's (Global War: The War Against Germany and Japan, 1939-45) game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3 months<br/>Hex: 500 miles / 804 kilometers<br/>Units: Army/Fleet<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; four color mapsheet or Two 17.5 x 22.5&quot; mounted mapboards (Designer box version)<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page World War 3 rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed player air cards<br/>One 6-sided die<br/>One counter storage tray (Designer box version)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6 hours<br/><br/>",1975,,,

Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan. In 1990 it was published by Hexagames in their &quot;Exklusiv&quot; series, and later (1993?) by Abacus in their very similar Abacus wood box series.<br/><br/>",1989,,,

Once you win an auction of the items that match each of your Curio cards you win the game. Item cards represent the items you can find for sale on the eBay website. During the game Item Cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder. There are 2 types of Bidding Cards: Money Cards and Action Cards.<br/><br/>First the Curio Cards are dealt according to the number of players ... 3 or 4 players = 5 Curio Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 4 Curio Cards each. Second the Item Cards are dealt face up in a row ... 3 or 4 players = 4 Item Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 5 Item Cards each. Third, each player is dealt 5 Bidding Cards. One D6 die is then placed on each Item Card matching the number showing on the die to the Number of Rounds field on the item. Finally, each player rolls a die. The highest roll receives the &quot;Starter&quot; Card and goes first.<br/><br/>One complete round of play consists of one turn per player and an Auction Update Phase. During each player's turn, they may perform any or all of the following actions in any order: 1) Draw hand back up to 5 Bidding Cards, 2) Discard one Item Card won on a previous turn to draw 3 Bidding Cards, 3) Either 3a) Play 1 Action Card and/or place 1 bid on an item, 3b) In lieu of placing a bid and/or playing an Action Card, you may discard as many Bidding Cards as you like. You redraw at the beginning of your next turn.<br/><br/>When each player has taken a turn, The &quot;Starter&quot; Card passes to the left.  After this, starting with the first Item Card, the die on each Item Card is lowered by one. When a die reaches zero, the auction is finished and all bids are revealed. Players may, at this point, play Action Cards which are allowed during this phase.<br/><br/>Action cards: Know Your Enemy, Bad Money Order, Tastes Change, Mass Amnesia, Offshore Financing, Lost Connection<br/><br/>Cards played during Auction Update Phase: Expensive Shipping, Reserve Price, Bad Feedback<br/><br/>You can change the length of the game by adding or subtracting the number of Curio Cards available.<br/><br/>(Most of the above was taken directly out of the rules sheet that comes with the game.

The &quot;mortal powers&quot; of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.<br/><br/>(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)<br/><br/>The basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

3634,Iberos: Overlords of the Ancient Peninsula,"['Action Points', 'Area Movement', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Ancient', 'Economic', 'Political', 'Wargame']","Extracted from consimworld.com:<br/><br/>IBEROS is an operational simulation of low to medium complexity of warfare in the Ancient Peninsula. It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.<br/><br/>The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.<br/><br/>Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Instead, players must concentrate their energies on implementing the sound military principles of maneuver and attack to defeat their opponent.

There are no &quot;tricks&quot; to be learned in this game.<br/><br/>SQUARES - The Civil War Battle Game contains no luck or chance element s; no dice, no spinners, no chance cards.

Although the theme is the same, and some of the mechanics are quite similar, crawling around on the floor, and spatial skills for estimating firing angles, make SFBM unlike Star Fleet Battles.<br/><br/>A playing area of perhaps 8 feet square is the minimum requirement, 12 feet square (or more) is better, with a bare floor or very short carpet. Two or more players plop down their starships on the floor. Everyone plots their moves simultaneously, allocating limited engine energy to some combination of movement, shields and weapons. Moves are executed simultaneously. Weapons have varying arcs of fire, and shield strength is independent on the four sides of the ship, so clever move plotting is critical to victory.<br/><br/>After movement, there is simultaneous combat. Shooting is the unusual element of the mechanics. Each starship has a compass card, with a silhouette in the middle. The player must estimate the exact correct angle to fire at, stretch out a string from the center of their card, and hope that their chosen angle intersects the silhouette of the chosen opponent.<br/><br/>Damage is logged in points against different capabilities of the starship, allowing for the damaged or crippled ships familiar from the Star Trek TV episodes and films. Different weapons and angles of fire allow for unique abilities for different races and starships.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1972 as Star Trek Battle Manual (this used the Star Trek name without having properly licensed it, and therefore was not sold for long).<br/><br/>The closely related Alien Space Battle Manual came out in 1973, offering a completely different set of alien races and somewhat different hit/damage rules, but allowing for interplay between the two different games.<br/><br/>",1977,,,

Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.<br/><br/>Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are.

3684,Dragons: The Classic Game,"['Enclosure', 'Pattern Building']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Played on a 5x5 square board, this Canadian game is subtitled &quot;The Classic Game&quot;, presumably because it is an orientally themed uber-variant of Tic Tac Toe.  Each of the 3x3 corner quadrants of board represent the different seasons, and the goal of the game is to get a row of three stacks of counters placed in one of the seasons.  Players alternate placement of counters on empty squares until such time as somebody gets three in a row in a season (or overlapping seasons).  When a row is formed, all single pieces in the involved seasons are removed, and the player's removed pieces are stacked onto the last played piece of his color.  One goal should always be to minimize stack sizes, because when you run out of pieces to play, you have to use up a turn reclaiming a non-critical stack from the board.  The first stack a player forms will of necessity be at least three high, but subsequent stacks can be held to two piece height due to the fact that stacks themselves are eventually used to help form rows, and only single pieces are removed to form new stacks.  First person to get three stacks within one season wins.<br/><br/>",0,,,

3716,Tractics,"['Dice Rolling', 'Line of Sight']","['Miniatures', 'Wargame', 'World War II']","Tracticts was created in 1971 by Mike Reese and Leon Tucker with contributions by Gary Gygax.<br/><br/>Its theme was World War 2 Combat and it was published by Guidon Games in 1971 and republished by TSR, Inc. in 1975. Its combat style involved 1:285 scale micro armour miniatures. When it was first created it used the 1/87 scale miniatures that were common but this later changed.<br/><br/>The game came as a boxed set containing three booklets illustrated by Don Lowry.<br/><br/>Tractics was innovative when it was published due to the fact that it was the first game that was published using a 20-sided die.<br/><br/>In 1968 Reese and Tucker, two members of the LGTSA, began play-testing rules for tank combat that would eventually form the core of Tractics. Gygax contributed some rules on infantry, covered in the second booklet, and the third booklet would cover additional topics such as airstrikes and the MODERN period (which at the time included rumors of the XM-1 tank).<br/><br/>The players must first acquire the miniatures and build the terrain. Reese and Tucker were interested in an accurate simulation, and as a result the game provides data describing the rate of movement, thickness of armor, and rate of fire for the makes of tank in service from 1940 to 1970. The tanks in Tractics have a 30% chance to hit a target which in essence means rolling at least a 15 on the 20 sided die. The modifiers of battle apply depending upon several factors such as concealment. The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered WWII only.<br/><br/>Tractics requires the use of a judge. Since players are unaware of their enemies locations, the pieces are placed on the map only when they are detected or they march to an open view.<br/><br/>",1971,,,

A full 9-inning game generally takes 30 minutes or less to complete.<br/><br/>Begin by choosing teams, pitchers, and line-ups. In order to simulate a real season, each player card indicates which positions a player is allowed to play, and for how many games that player played at each position during a full season.<br/><br/>Each at-bat is simulated the same way. First, a Fast Action Card (FAC) is drawn to determine a PB number which is then compared to the PB rating on the pitcher's card; this determines if the pitcher&rsquo;s card or the batter&rsquo;s card is &quot;in control&quot;. Then a new FAC is drawn to generate a random number to determine the result from the player's card who was &quot;in control&quot;. Each of the 98 FAC has four results&mdash;two per side, one right-side up, one upside-down and also features special PB results to simulate clutch batting, clutch fielding, unusual plays (e.g. dropped third strike, ejections, etc.), and injuries.<br/><br/>If an out is made, an out chart appropriate to the runner situation (e.g. Bases Empty, Runner on Second, etc.) is consulted to determine the outcome by drawing an additional FAC (or two, if the out result has a chance of error to be checked).<br/><br/>Charts on the playing board support managerial choices such as sacrifice bunts, hit and runs, stolen base attempts, etc. For these, no PB number is determined; simply consult the FAC&rsquo;s random number and follow the chart&rsquo;s instructions which usually involves consulting players ratings appropriately (e.g. base runner&rsquo;s stolen base rating, catcher&rsquo;s throwing ability, etc.).<br/><br/>Production of the game was halted after the 1992 baseball season on account of a royalties dispute between Avalon Hill and MLB.

3784,Die Schätze des Ali Baba,[],"['Arabian', 'Novel-based']","The Treasures of Ali  Baba<br/><br/>extrapolated from a review done by Kevin Whitmore<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player starts with a pawn in the bottom corner of the board. At the opposite corner of the board is the entrance to the cave. Every turn each player rolls a D6 to move. Players must move their pawns in a clockwise direction along the edge of the board upon a narrow track. At the left-hand corner is a space marked &ldquo;W&uuml;ste&rdquo; (Desert). Each pawn must stop there. To leave the desert a player must roll an odd number. Upon reaching the far corner players must pause on the corner before opening the mountain.<br/><br/>The heart of the game happens within the cave. The cave is large, dominating the game mat. Up to 40 square cards can be placed face down, one per space, within the cave. This number will be reduced if the optional obstacles and tea light are used. The cards show the same back, depicting a vase. When a pawn ends its move on a vase the active player may inspect it, and claim the treasure shown. In addition, the player rolls a die to see if they break the vase. If not, they replace the treasure card with a blank card showing the same vase on the back. In this way the game board becomes depleted of treasures and filled up with worthless empty vases, or voids where vases were broken.<br/><br/>Complicating the player&rsquo;s lives is the band of 40 thieves. Really it is just the black pawn, but he travels the board seeking to prevent the players from absconding with the treasures. Combat slightly favors the black pawn, encouraging all the players to give him a wide berth.<br/><br/>As players collect more treasures, they become encumbered, and forfeit movement points as their load increases. This allows the black pawn to possibly catch a player&rsquo;s pawn. However, some of the treasure cards are empty backpacks and sacks, allowing a pawn to carry more treasure before becoming encumbered. Further, the black pawn is slow, rolling a special die with a top value of four.<br/><br/>Once a pawn has escaped from the cave, he must continue clockwise upon the track along the edge of the board.

Think of them as atoms. With just these core rules you will not be able to play much. What you can do with them though is build up Gameworlds that take the CGME Core Rules and fill in the details of the game setting you want to play.<br/><br/>The Gameworlds are the source documents that will add the detail to the Core Rule's atomic structure. They will describe things like a worlds terrain, the units available, their strengths and weaknesses, the climate, special rules that modify combat resolution, new rules that cover things like horse back ridding, vector space ship movement, and just how to handle a Vogon star destroyer that has wandered into your Medieval Fantasy realm.<br/><br/>By building off the same Core Rules and by using the Gameworlds you have created, or have been created by others, you can then build up Gamesets to cover the specific events to play out. For example, by using the CGME Core Rules coupled with the CGME Space Gameworld you could build a Gameset to play interstellar battles, trade wars across colonial star systems, early 1970's Soviet vs. US orbital conflicts, and many more.<br/><br/>If a Gameworld does not cover all the details you need to play out your event, you are free to haul off and add in what you need, modify what is there and hopefully make it available so others can use it.<br/><br/>CGME is freely available in Volume 1 Issue 1 of Countermoves<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Jovima challenges each wayfarer to dare the Trial by Pylon, a trial in which you risk your very life to attain some of his wealth and powers.<br/><br/>Whether you are a Novice, a Warrior, or a Sorcerer, the elements of chance are always testing your skills. A simple treasure hunt can easily become a fight for survival. Up to six players may confront Jovima in their quest for fortune.<br/><br/>&mdash;publisher description<br/><br/>An independently produced hack-and-slash fantasy card game. Per the rulebook, the first edition was limited to 5000 numbered copies. Some or all of these first edition copies were signed by the designer and artists.

The Novice level is a solitaire game that allows a player to become familiarized with the Location, Weapon, Treasure, and Peril (monster) cards. Warrior level challenges the players to be the one who escapes the realm with the greatest amount of treasure. To win at the Sorcerer level, a player must exit the realm with Jovima's four most precious treasures, thereby becoming an Adept at the Trial by Pylon.<br/><br/>The game includes six characters, each of which has a special points advantage in regards to some or all of the &quot;Perils&quot; that will be encountered in the realm. Players switch to a different character if the one the player started with is killed off.<br/><br/>Character, Weapon, Location, and Peril cards are randomly distributed at start, and during the game by drawing from the respective decks. Players use their character's special advantage, along with weapons possessed by the character, to overcome the peril found at a location in order to win the treasure being guarded by the peril. Combat is a straight comparison of the Power number for the weapon used by the character, plus any character bonuses, against the Strength value of the Peril card, adjusted for the Location when applicable (classes of monsters are stronger when in certain locations, or sometimes weaker). The Weapon card is discarded after use.<br/><br/>Treasures can be used to buy weapons, and sometimes to bribe a peril. Escape cards allow a player to successfully avoid a peril, or perhaps end the Trial by Pylon - but beware the appearance of Jovima, who can bring your quest to a sudden conclusion!<br/><br/>Trial by Pylon is not solely a dungeon-crawling adventure.

The mechanism for doing so involves following the real life process of getting female offspring from an animal that is considered typical of the breed and showing no obvious signs of cross breeding (and thus qualified to be entered in the &quot;A&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register of the Herd Book maintained by the Society as ASR). These female offspring would be qualified to be entered in the &quot;B&quot; Section of the Supplementary Register as BSR cows, and their pure bred offspring would in turn qualify as CSR animals. The daughters of CSR animals can then be registered in the Herd Book proper and become full pedigree cows.<br/><br/>Full pedigree animals that achieve certain standards of milk and butterfat production then can be entered into the Register of Merit (can carry the suffix RM) and an RM cow that has calved at least three times, had two yearly yields entered in the RM and has at least 76 point in Type Classification (out of 100 in a system of grading desired breed characteristics) in turn qualifies as an RMX standard cow (X for Excellent).<br/><br/>RMX cows who achieve a lifetime milk yield of at least 50 long tonnes and have scored at least 85 point in Type Classification finally qualify to grade up to Elite Cow.<br/><br/>The object in simplified game terms is to be the first player to grade up at least 4 cows (out of a starting 6) to that Elite Cow status and thus win the game.<br/><br/>",1986,,,

By collecting goods (salt, barley, tea, jade, and gold), you can make offers to monasteries, send out delegations to different regions or bargain to increase your livestock. All this to become the most prosperous caravaneer in all of the Himalaya!<br/><br/>Players program their caravans around the paths on the Himalayan plateau to collect various goods, and then deliver them.  Each turn players plan in advance six moves for their caravan, trying to second-guess what other players will do to their best advantage.  Delivering goods allows the player to increase their influence in one of three separate categories - each delivery allows you to advance your position in two of the three categories.  Religious influence is marked by the number and value of your stupas in buildings on the board, political influence is marked by the number of sherpas you have in the regions between the paths on the board, and economical influence is marked by the total number of yaks you have on your delivery disks.<br/><br/>The scoring is unique to the game, in the 4 player game anyway (the player count the game is primarily designed to be played with).  To determine the winner you first score up religious influence, and the player with the least religious influence is eliminated, and their remaining pieces are removed from the board.  Next the player with the least political influence is eliminated.  The remaining two players decide the winner by who has the greatest economic influence.

3810,Gusher,[],['Industry / Manufacturing'],"Gusher is the direct ancestor of Oil Power and King Oil and is similar in concept. The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells (&quot;gushers&quot;). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.<br/><br/>Although the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.<br/><br/>In a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers. A game generally requires about 20 complete turns.<br/><br/>Early 1940's editions employ a 20.5&quot; x 20.5&quot; game board; these feature boxes with deep, dark colors and silvered print.

There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the  word that is written on card  by using sentences to describe the word.  For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn.

The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board.

The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.<br/><br/>Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3.

Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards.

It was most popular about five hundred years ago and was played by Monks in churches as well as on village greens throughout England.<br/><br/>The game is for two players.  One player has nine black playing pieces, the other has nine white playing pieces.  The first player to reduce their opponent to two pieces wins.<br/><br/>In the first stage of the game players take turns placing their pieces on the board, attempting to make a line of three.  Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three.  Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice.  When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three.  As soon as one player is left with only two pieces, his opponent wins.<br/><br/>",-1400,,,

With acquisition and tracking ranges measured in tens of thousands of kilometers, to human eyes the people that are trying to kill you are not even a speck.  But they can hurt you, even though you can't see them.  Precise laster arrays and big particle accelerators, honed by centuries of engineering, can reach out without warning to slit your hull like the belly of a fish, spilling life--oxygen, heat, and fuel--into the hard vacuum.  That's why space combat is a game of cat and mouse.  Keep yourself wrapped in the mantle of space--cold, dark, silent.  Keep your thrust burns to a minimum--they blaze like miniature suns for all to detect.  Rig your passive sensors to greedily absorb data, but remain quiet yourself--give nothing away.  Keep your weapons ready, in case&hellip; There!  A faint trace of mid-wavelength infrared betrays a meneuver drive.  Bring up the ladar dishes while the big passive array builds up a targeting solution.  The moments seem endless while every crewmember shares the same thought: &quot;Have they seen us?&quot; It is the unseen enemy at this moment doing the same thing that you are?  You might never know the answer.  If you beat him, maybe you'll find out.  But what if you hadn't seen him first?

The expansion of your navy and armies can take what should be rightfully yours.

3948,Jolly Roger: Treasure Islands,"['Bias', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Race', 'Square Grid']","['Fantasy', 'Nautical', 'Pirates']","From the Italian company International Team comes this fairly simple game of piracy on the high seas.<br/><br/>On a map that can only be considered a fantasy world you sail your galleon around the outer islands picking up treasure chests in the hope of delivering the treasures to his island in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Movement is handled by way of a wind disk. Every 3 turns this disk turns and the wind will be coming from a new direction. A ship always moves in a straight line that can be at a diagonal. If it is sailing in the direction of the wind it must move 4 spaces. If in a diagonal with the wind it must move 5 spaces. If perpendicular to the wind movement is 3 spaces. If diagonal against the wind movement is 2 spaces and if against the wind 1 space. The wind rotates in a rigid sequence so you can always plan what your ship will be doing. If a ship runs onto land it is sunk. A ship can stop short of its full movement if it is in a harbor square of which each island has one. On the outer islands this is where a galleon picks up treasures and each may carry up to 3. The board wraps around on itself so if a ship sails off an edge it reappears on the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>There are 6 dark areas on the seas that can become storms. The start player rolls 2 die at the beginning of his turn and puts a marker on the corresponding areas. Ships cannot enter these and ships that are in these areas cannot move.<br/><br/>Each player also has a frigate. Frigates attempt to pass over another ship, regardless of the type, which will sink it. A sunken ship will always reappear at that player&rsquo;s island at the start of his next turn. Frigates may not dock at harbors so they cannot end their movement short when passing over one. Ships sunk have their treasures returned to the bank.<br/><br/>You play until a player has collected an agreed to amount of treasures. The rules suggest 8 to 20.<br/><br/>The rules take up 3 small pages of which half the page is rules in another language. There are also 4 illustrations in the rules so you end up with about 1 page of rules. Some things are very vague though. How the Disk of Winds is used is not very clear. Here logic can get you through. The islands in the center are not marked as belonging to anyone so I have always had each player put a treasure on one to claim it. We have also played that the islands belong to no one player and you just need to get you treasures to an island. This makes it a lot easier to dock and drop off treasures.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

It is very similar to the basic Checkers game.<br/><br/>On each turn, players may only move in a diagonal direction. If a player's piece cannot move to a square, as an opponent's piece is occupying it, the piece is instead moved to the following diagonal square and the opponent's piece is removed from the board (captured). If the following space has another piece in it, the aforementioned move cannot be made. If, in capturing a piece, you are in a position to capture another piece, you may do so until no further pieces can be captured. This is the only time multiple moves may be taken per turn.<br/><br/>Quad Checkers differs from the original game in that, adjacent to each edge of the board, is an additional 8x3 grid. This is the starting point of the playing pieces for each of the 4 players. From here, pieces move out into the main grid where the competitive play takes place.<br/><br/>The game is lost for a player if he/she cannot move or if all of his/her pieces are eliminated from the board.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

3954,Baseball Strategy,"['Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Simulation']","['Dice', 'Math', 'Memory', 'Sports']","Welcome to the best FTF fantasy baseball board game ever created. This baseball game is for people who like meat and potatoes with a side of greens. It is the whole enchilada. When playing it you will use your intuition or feel to pick up patterns leading to decisions to outwit your opponent. If you can deal with, &quot;Take that!&quot;, you will like this game. Baseball Strategy is not meant for the shy, but the hearty. Great baseball action. Thrilling too! Never a dull moment and you will actually feel like a batter or a pitcher, manager or a base coach, etc. when you play this game.  Then you can live out your fantasies of being a big-league ball player! At least that's the idea is promoting here and what's wrong with that? Let's face it. Even if you just played wiffle ball in your backyard, haven't you fantasied hitting one into the upper deck at Tiger Stadium, especially having seen a slugger do that many times in your life? It would be nice to hear the cheers as you formally rounded the bases with alacrity to score. Baseball Strategy seems to capture the psychological battle between pitcher and batter quite well. Experience the excitement of getting a bases loaded, bases clearing double when you anticipated the pitch correctly, but you will also experience the agony when you don't! This game is unlike any other baseball game this author has ever played. There are rules for series play in order to give proper rest to pitchers where the entire pitching staff is used and not just the &quot;Aces&quot;.  Series play is highly recommended to have a full &quot;baseball fantasy&quot; playing experience. The game now even has variant injury possibilities, video replay challenges, robs of hit opportunities, MLB Defensive &quot;Leather Larceny&quot; Highlight Plays, setting the infield at DP depth and more.<br/>This fantasy is a cat and mouse game (and vice versa) hiding in plain sight where the two gamers enter a complex matrix of double blind decisions that lead to the inevitable think and counter-think, out witting duel.  Gamers begin by first selecting their lineups from imaginary players or actual players by converting their stats to the game's parameters. (This is easily done from mlb.com on the net or baseball-reference.com.).  If you don&rsquo;t like agony, this game isn&rsquo;t for you!<br/>Enter The Matrix: The Defensive team is the manager and catcher, selecting pitch types (Fast Ball, Off Speed, Pitch out, etc.) to send batters fuming back to the dugout, sometimes with specific outs in a certain situation. Batters attempt to get a hit, get on base or at the least make an out that moves runners into scoring position/ or of course, scoring. (that's the idea, right?) Each tries to anticipate the other's tendencies throughout the game in order to &quot;exploit&quot; them.<br/>After a pitch card is played by the pitcher, the batter must then select a type of offense/ball in play strategy (Steal, Bunt, Hit and Run, Long Ball, etc.)The results of the two choices are found by cross indexing them on a result matrix table. Players can decide on the size of ballpark before the game.<br/><br/>",1960,,,

The spaces on the board are color coded to each of the 4 categories of questions, and are marked with a number (10, 7, 4, and 1) that corresponds to the difficulty of the clue.

A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.<br/><br/>Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends.

There have been three Succession Wars to date, but no victor. The cost of war is high. The leaders of the Successor States must weigh each maneuver to see whether the gain in territory is worth the loss of 'Mechs.

The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).<br/><br/>The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.<br/><br/>The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.<br/><br/>Originally published in S&amp;T 50 - May/Jun 1975<br/><br/>",1975,,,

When placing cows, players try to achieve Cow Lock, which is two identically-colored orthogonally adjacent cows. Four cows in a square is called a Bovine Doom Block. Next, each player places their alien chit on the center square of their edge of the board (on the grid, but outside the fence). They take turns moving the alien up to 3 spaces, and then they may choose to tip cows. Tipping starts from the alien and stops at a Cow Lock -- the alien cannot tip a cow directly into a cow of the same color. The player then collects all tipped cows.<br/><br/>To determine individual scores, each player tallies their cows, subtracting the number of cows of their color from the remaining cows. High score wins.<br/><br/>In the 2-player game, each player uses a single alien marker as normal, but chooses and places cows of 2 colors. Cow Lock and Bovine Doom Block can still only be achieved with cows of the same color.<br/><br/><br/>From the packaging:<br/>In Udder Madness you are an alien engaged in a contest with your alien pals to see who can tip the most cows of your opponents while tipping as few of your own as possible.<br/><br/>Why an alien, you ask? Well there are a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>One reason is that by now, any alien visitors we may have must surely have grown bored with abducting people and examining their nether-regions. So with nether-regions out, and crop circles quickly becoming pass, they're going to need some new mystifying activity... Why not this?<br/><br/>The second reason is that we at Placebo Press could not possibly believe that an actual human being, no matter how depraved or intoxicated, would participate in such an activity outside of the confines of a harmless board game? Hence it must be aliens. I don't think that our logic is flawed here.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.<br/><br/>Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.<br/><br/>The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.<br/><br/>The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.<br/><br/>Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.<br/><br/>Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.<br/><br/>End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

The same year Hex appeared in the Danish newspaper Politiken under the name Polygon. Hein introduced the game to the readers on December 26, 1942 and during the following four months gave them a problem each day to begin with - eventually two days a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays. The solution would always appear in the following column. It was independently invented by mathematician John Nash in 1947 at Princeton University. In 1952, Parker Brothers marketed a version. They called their version Hex, and the name stuck. Hex has the simplest rules of almost any game: connect your color edges with a path of tokens of your color. There is also a &quot;swap rule&quot; (also known as a pie rule) which compensates for the inherent advantage of the first player.<br/><br/>There are a number of resources for Hex on the internet, including several real-time servers. If you want to play face-to-face, used Hex sets are occasionally available, and you can also make your own set. A Battlemat with 1&quot; hexes can be cut into a 15x15 rhombus grid. Standard Go stones also work well for this board.  It is also playable as a pencil-and-paper game, like the 3M Paper Game version.<br/><br/>",1942,,,

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River<br/><br/>The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.<br/><br/>During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.<br/><br/>As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive?

You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.<br/><br/>There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.<br/><br/>How ARNE Works!<br/><br/>Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards.

In all essential details the &quot;Hyena Game&quot; seems to have been identical to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen (The Game of the Coiled One).  The board's shape suggests it may be a distant ancestor of the Game of Goose but the mechanics are so different that this is probably a coincidence.<br/><br/>It was played on a spiraling track, employed stick dice (throwing sticks) of precisely the kind known from Archaic Egyptian contexts, and had two types of pieces, one representing a predatory animal.  The only difference would seem to be that the ancient Egyptians allotted six counters to each player rather than only one.  The Cretan Phaistos Disc may have been a Mehen board, but that remains speculation.<br/><br/>Mehen is the only multi-player ancient Egyptian board game known, the others (Senet, Aseb, Hounds &amp; Jackals, etc.) being all two-player games.  The main function of the serpent-shaped Egyptian god Mehen was to protect the sun-god Ra from his enemies by coiling around him.  In the Old Kingdom, the race-game Mehen took the name and shape of the god: a coiled serpent with the gaming spaces on its back.  As &quot;bodyguard&quot;, Mehen symbolises the sun-god's immediate neighborhood for the deceased.  The deceased walks towards Ra on the back of the serpent-god.<br/><br/>By the early Middle Kingdom, the &lsquo;cuts&rsquo; used on the snake's back of the Mehen board to separate the playing spaces were thought to &lsquo;kill&rsquo; the snake &mdash;which would have been a very threatening and evil thing.  Mehen&rsquo;s role was essential, for if Ra were not protected from his enemies, he might not rise in the morning, which would result in the cessation of all life.  In Egyptian belief, &lsquo;life&rsquo; applied not only to the living but also to the dead, who were believed to travel with the sun and to rise, reborn, with him at dawn.  From that time forth, the game apparently ceased to be played, possibly banned and forbidden.<br/><br/>",-3000,,,

4168,Blitzkrieg,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']","['Wargame', 'World War II']","Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.<br/><br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.<br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply &quot;hexes&quot;), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.<br/><br/>The cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Naval action is allowed but abstracted.<br/><br/>There are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.<br/><br/>The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game is not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.<br/><br/>The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had ratings printed in large print on the piece, (or &quot;chits,&quot; as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, higher odds will favor that side.<br/><br/>Also in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).<br/><br/>When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.<br/><br/>In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.<br/><br/>",1965,,,
4169,Deathtrap Dungeon: Card Game,['Ladder Climbing'],"['Card Game', 'Fantasy']","The Deathtrap Dungeon card game came with some copies of the PC version of the Deathtrap Dungeon computer game by EIDOS. The cards themselves feature a whole host of nasties, including Skeletons, Orcs and Bloodbeasts. The game is actually based on an ancient Chinese card game called &quot;Zheng Shang Yu&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal of Deathtrap Dungeon is to 'kill' all the monsters by discarding cards, all of which have a creature on them. The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.<br/><br/>Players arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>The winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round. A note is made of the order the players finish in, and they are then ranked:<br/><br/>Winner = The Big Hero! <br/>2nd place = The Hero <br/>2nd to last place = The Wimp <br/>Last place = The Total Wimp!<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and re-dealt for the second round, but before the game begins again, The Total Wimp must hand over their 2 highest cards to The Big Hero and the Big Hero gives back any two of their cards. This also happens with The Wimp and The Hero. The game continue until 4 rounds have been played.<br/><br/>There are also Special cards in the deck. Also included are Chaindog and Red Lotus, two player characters from the computer game, and can be used to add to any set, however played on their own they have a value of 0. The Killing Machine, which can be played on its own at any time, stops a hand, the player that used it begins the next hand.<br/><br/>",1998,,,

Veracruz is an operational simulation of General Winfield Scott's Mexican campaign, which took place between March and September 1847. The invasion was an American effort to end the Mexican War by marching into the heart of Central Mexico to capture the capital, Mexico City. Diplomatically, it ended the decades of border disputes and opened up vast new territories, which in turn led to the Gold Rush of '49 and the Great Compromise of 1850.<br/><br/>European commanders and military experts, when viewing the upcoming conflict in 1846, could not see anything but a complete Mexican victory, given the size of her army with it's European system of training and assembly. But the European System was a hollow shell that worked with even less validity in the rigid hierarchical Mexican social structure. The entire system was exacerbated by a succession of generals and other leaders who were inept on a scale that dwarfs even the darkest Union days of the Civil War. On the other hand, many of the best generals of the American Civil War distinguished themselves here as lieutenants and captains: Robert E. Lee (engineers, Scott's chief scout), Ulysses S. Grant, George Pickett, Thomas J. Jackson, Braxton Bragg, Jubal Early, George G. Meade, Phillip Kearney, David D. Porter (USN), and Jefferson Davis, to name a few.<br/><br/>The map depicts central Mexico down to Mexico City, the target of the American player.

After the last and greatest war, some people survived underground.  But radiation had penetrated even there and they were forced from their new homes.  They rebuilt their great cities as floating platforms to carry them above the radiation belts that now encircled their planet.  Some launched themselves to safety before it was too late, but others were slow or miscalculated.  Their sky born heirs were mutated, some horribly beyond belief, others invisibly.  The centuries passed and the radioactivity began to fade away.  The sky cities began to look for ways downward to the planet.  But they found each other first, humans and non-humans, as allies or competitors.  Then started what man had left off: WAR.<br/><br/>You are the ruler of a sky-city.  Your objective is to capture or destroy your enemies, and find an opening in the radiation belts.  The action occurs in the upper atmosphere, about 55 to 75 miles off the surface of the Earth.<br/><br/>WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is an exciting two-player science fiction table top game, where players become rulers of complete cities in the sky.  Each side has small scout/research centers, medium battle cities, and/or large battle cities.  There are two objectives: capture or destroy your enemies and find an opening in the deadly radiation belts surrounding a future Earth.  In addition, optional rules introduce the use of small fighter craft and airborne landing parties.  WAR OF THE SKY CITIES is a game of tactical &quot;air&quot; combat, but instead of aircraft you command large floating cities with their own engines, armour and weapons.<br/><br/>The components include two pages of cardstock counters and a cardstock reference sheet (printed on one side).<br/><br/>Game Scale: Each inch represents 200 miles.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

The game involves the quest of the fellowship and the military situation simultaneously.<br/><br/>As the game was not properly licensed, it was quickly pulled from distribution and is, as a result, quite rare.<br/><br/>(Description from the Diplomacy Boardgame Compendium and Gallery)<br/><br/>This game is based on the basic game mechanics of Diplomacy (moves, holds, supports and convoys), but is set in Tolkien's world of Middle Earth.  The game is played either by two opponents or four players (two per team, one controlling armies and fleets and one controlling the other individuals).  Because the game is intended to be played by two opponents (a person or a team), the one part of the traditional game of Diplomacy that is not preserved in this game is the diplomacy itself.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of negotiations, the basic game mechanics are taken from Diplomacy but with a number of extensions or modifications.  Armies and fleets are supported by supply centers, but can have single, double, or triple strength.  In addition to armies and fleets, there are a number of characters/roles, such as Gandalf, Strider, The Ringbearer, and the Nazgul, each of which has certain attributes or abilities (for example some characters increase the strength of the army they accompany).  There are a variety of special rules regarding terrain, as well as victory points given in special circumstances such as The Ringbearer getting to Mount Doom, a Nazgul with the Ring getting to Barad-Dur, the Ring being captured by Mordor's strongest army, and others.<br/><br/>",1976,,,

Each player is a young elf traveling through Fantasy Forest.  In the middle of the forest is the Magic Mountain where Morley the Wizard lives.  The first player to reach Morley's castle wins.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of three cards.  Cards show a monster type and a number.  They are used to move your elf ahead on the path or to challenge another player to a duel.  Playing the right color cards at certain points on the board allows a player to take shortcuts.<br/><br/>Red spots on the board are ambush spaces.  Players landing there must play a card face-up from their hand and then draw the top card off the deck.  If the player's card is higher than the drawn card, they move forward the number of spaces equal to their card's number.  If their card is lower than the drawn card, they move backwards the number of spaces equal to the drawn card's number.<br/><br/>Duels are handled the same way, only they are between players and the winner gets to move to the space in front of the losing player (assuming it is forward movement along the path).  In this way players are never really out of the running because they can challenge the leader anytime they draw a strong card.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

This game is designed to give the atmosphere of a corrupt, money-grabbing Europe, torn by military strife, when almost everyone's first thoughts were for self-interest: truly a mercenary age.<br/><br/>Mercenary covers the period of European history from the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII of France to the French Wars of Religion in 1560.  The game, therefore, consists of 11 turns each 6 years in length.

After a promising start, the offensive was stopped on 15 May by massive airstrikes. Critical Soviet errors by several staff officers and by Joseph Stalin, who failed to accurately estimate the 6th Army's potential and overestimated their own newly raised forces, facilitated a German pincer attack on 17 May which cut off three Soviet field armies from the rest of the front by 22 May.

Preferably, the Players should become familiar with the Standard Garne first and then increase the level of complexity until they find a rules mix with which they are most comfortable.<br/><br/>The key to the game lies in the combination of a unique combat system and a new untried unit procedure. Basically, each ground combat unit consists of three &quot;steps&quot; and an untried status. As a unit enters combat, its actual strength&mdash; which may be greater or less than its normal face-value &mdash; must be determined. Combat results are expressed in terms of &quot;retreat points&quot; which must be expended either by retreating and/or by taking step losses. Since the owning player controls the path and method of retreat, there is a wide range of possible outcomes from each combat situation.<br/><br/>Fulda Gap Shows the likely impact of a great number of factors on modern warfare. Supply and movement systems stress the importance of roads and autobahns; rules are provided to reflect the importance of divisional integrity, artillery, helicopters, airmobile units, replacements, Soviet doctrine, field fortifications, and disengagement.

They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds.

Curtis. This battle decided the fate of the trans-Mississippi region. Historically, the Union prevailed and Missouri was denied to the Confederates.<br/><br/>The game covers the two days of the battle, and creates rules for reorganization during the night. Rebels start the game with the initiative as Union brigades race to meet and slow the massive CSA advance, allowing later Union troopers to move into defensive positions.<br/><br/>Initiative passes to the Yankees on the second day, if the Rebels don't win outright on the first day. Victory is determined by killing units and capturing geographical objectives.<br/><br/>Each Game-Turn represents 30 minutes of real time, and each hex covers about 125 yards from hexside to hexside. Each Strength Point is the equivalent of 100 men or 1 gun. The system created a set of standard rules for all the GBACW games, and then added exclusive rules specific to that battle. 200 counters.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

4287,Onslaught,"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Wargame', 'World War II']","Wargame based around the WW2 Western Allied campaign from just after the Normandy invasion to the crossing of the Rhine.<br/><br/>First significant mechanic is the unpredictable turn order - players dice for each turn, with the highest taking the turn. However, ties end that month's play (players draw fresh supply points each month, and the game ends after 20 months).<br/><br/>Second significant mechanic is the use of (limited) supply points to activate stacks of units when it's your turn. Like games such as We the People/Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage/Rommel in the Desert/Napoleon, you don't have the resources to activate all of your units each turn, you need to decide what the current priority is in line with the current situation. Activation generally allows you to either move stacks or attack with stacks, but with an increased expenditure of supply points, you can take more powerful 'breakthrough' turns involving both movement and attack.<br/><br/>These mechanics (unpredictable turn order, limited ability to activate units each turn) create a game of fluid tactical situations, where your planning has to be flexible - you never know who will get the next turn.<br/><br/>The Allied player has to break out of the beach head and capture additional supply ports (which raise the number of supply points available to the Allies, and hence the number of activations possible) en route to Germany. The German player must contain the Allies in Normandy for as long as possible before falling back to the Rhine, while also denying the valuable supply ports to the Allies as long as possible. The Allies are up against a tight timetable; the Germans must work against as increasing disadvantage in supply points.<br/><br/>Victory is generally determined by the difference in numbers between German units West of the Rhine and Allied units East of the Rhine at game end. Allied paratroops, the German Bulge offensive, reinforcements/replacements and strategic movement add to the game. The big mounted map with large hexes and counters remove the 'fiddle factor' which can blight wargames with lower production values.<br/><br/>Republished in Command Magazine Japan #64 in 2005.<br/><br/>",1987,,,

It could be played in any of three ways.<br/>In the preferred method, a slightly souped-up version of &quot;Authors,&quot; the player to the left of the dealer reads the quote on one of his cards. If the next player knows which play the quote is from and needs that card for a set of the four scenes from that play, he gets it. Completed sets are laid down on the table, and whoever has the most sets at the end of the game wins.<br/>&quot;When mere amusement is desired and the educational feature not cared for,&quot; the second game play method is the most basic version of &quot;Authors&quot; in which the players ask each other if they have a card for a particularly play. The third game play method is, strangely, a non-bidding four-handed partnered trick-taking game in which the four series of scenes substitute for the four suits in a regular card deck, with the &quot;A&quot; series always being trump.<br/>The maximum number of players for the third method is four. The maximum number for the other methods could be higher, but it might prove difficult to build sets.

These triangles are the way you score points.<br/><br/>In the basic game, each time you make a triangle using the same symbol (or entirely empty) you score 2 points.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, you start the game with one of the colors as your own, and if someone else scores with your color, they must share the points. Also, at the end of the game, if any of your witches are free along the edge of the board, you gain additional points. Witchy objects at the edge will cost you points.<br/><br/>The 3rd game is solitaire. The rules show 4 different shapes and you must try to lay all the tiles to form that shape while adhering to the normal placement rules.

In the basic game, two, three, or four players control mining companies that mine asteroids for ore, gas, and highly dangerous shards of CT (contra-terrene matter -- a name for antimatter lifted from the Seetee novels of Jack Williamson). These commodities are traded for credits at the three major planetoid stations. Vicious fights can break out over control of particularly lucrative asteroids. The players have to agree on the winning conditions: The winner is either the first player to one million, ten million, or a hundred million credits, or the wealthiest player after a set timespan elapses. (The playing time is, accordingly, completely arbitrary; two hours is probably too short, but seems like a sane number.)<br/><br/>In the advanced game, an additional player plays the Peace Keeping Force (PKF), whose role is ironically not to stop the fighting, but to suppress revolts and other conflicts just enough to keep prices of ore and gas low. The PKF player achieves partial victory if the price of either commodity is below 200 credits at the end of the game, or decisive victory if the prices of both commodities are below 200 credits.<br/><br/>Includes: 480 counters<br/><br/>",1979,,,

Merchants from the rich provinces of Holland and neighboring Zealand gather in stately rooms to discuss the foundation of a mighty consortium: a company that will hold the monopoly of the very profitable East Indies trade.  One question occupies their minds more than anything: who will control the new company?<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of a merchant living at the end of the sixteenth century.  These merchants sent out ships to explore and expand the profitable trade in the east, where they traded cloves, nutmeg, silk and tea in such remote areas as India, Indonesia, China and Japan.  These goods were then sold at great profit in the West.  The journey, however, was a dangerous one, and fitting out a ship was prohibitively expensive.  Merchants therefore cooperated in small groups, called compagnies in Dutch, to fit out ships together.<br/><br/>At the same time, competition was cutthroat, not just abroad, but also at home, where Amsterdam was the most fearsome rival.  Your task in this game is to make as large a profit as you can - but at the same time uphold the honor of your hometown against the mighty merchants from Amsterdam.<br/><br/>This box contains two game versions: the basic game, which can be played by 4 or 5 players, and the advanced game, for 3 to 5 players.

First player to amass 100 Consumer points wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a die.  If it is 1-4, you go visit the corresponding dealer.  If you rolled yourself, you pick one of the three others.  If you rolled 5-6, you draw a Consumer card and then go visit a dealer of your choice.  The Consumer cards give small Consumer Point bonuses or penalties, or small cash awards (up to 500 $).  At the beginning of each round, all players receive 100 $ each.<br/><br/>Each dealer has six cards, one Catch card, two Rip-Off cards and three Good Deal cards.  They are spread in front of him, face down, in any order of the dealer's choice.  The consumer then decides how much he will spend (100-400 $) and forks the money over to the vendor.  The dealer then rolls a die and picks up the corresponding card (left to right) from his spread; next, he chooses one of the five remaining cards.  Finally, he picks up the card corresponding to the amount spent (100 $ - first card, and so on up to 400 $ - fourth card).  Thus the dealer has limited control over what choice to offer to the consumer.<br/><br/>The consumer then draws one of the three cards proferred by the dealer (still face down).  If a Good Deal, he receives 10-40 Consumer points.  If a Catch, he receives half as much.  If a Rip-Off, he *loses* 10 Consumer points but has the option of suing.<br/><br/>To sue, pay 500 $ to the Bank, then dice off against the vendor.  If the consumer rolls lower, he lost the suit.  If he tied or bested the vendor, he is awarded compensation depending on the margin of success.  The least result is that he recovers the lost 10 CPs and is refunded the court costs by the vendor.  The vendor may be forced to pay such a large penalty that he goes into debt.  If your debt gets larger than 1000 $, you are  bankrupt and out of the game.  Whilst in debt, you cannot buy when your turn comes, but instead just draw a Consumer card.  All income goes to pay off the debt.<br/><br/>",1975,,,

(Where have we seen this before?) Each robot is represented by a composite miniature that you put together using the available components. There are two different command units (heads), two main thrusters (bottoms), and four equipment tenders (middle pieces with six slots in them), with which you can make Scouts (combots with one tender), Warriors (two tenders), or Marauders (three tenders), although you don't get enough tenders with the game to build a pair of Marauders.<br/><br/>Now comes the fun part. Not only can you custom-design your combots, you can actually build them by sliding various modules into the slots in the equipment tenders: claw arms, lasers, laser shields, aiming units, missile launchers, armor plates, etc., etc. When you're ready, deploy your combots at either end of the included diamond-shaped hex map and guide them into battle; the last robot with any remaining functional offensive modules wins.<br/><br/>Approximate playing time is a guess. Two players is the maximum for a standard game; scenarios are provided that allow up to five players to play in the diamond map, or more players in user-designed maps, but you would have to buy either extra copies of the game or components for additional miniatures.<br/><br/>",1983,,,

In this particular future, gangs of street thugs have (again) become enamored of the world of modern professional sports. Unfortunately, they have no real idea of how these modern sports were played, besides what they can guess from old photographs and what they know about the sports of their day. If all future sports use multiple balls, surely so did the sports of the twentieth century, right? And even if they didn't, they should have.<br/><br/>Thus was born Fightball, a weird version of basketball with at least three balls &mdash; maybe more, we're not sure &mdash; two goals, and extremely violent gameplay. The sport is played on the streets and overseen by flying robot referees, and it's played by the weirdest assortment of folks you're likely to see in a game.<br/><br/>Basically, Fightball is like basketball. Players build a &quot;court&quot; out of 24 cards and play four rounds. The play is fast and furious, with each player playing as fast as he can. When one player reaches the &quot;BUZZ&quot; card (at the bottom of the deck) the round is over. Now, players score each location on the court, looking for a sequence of cards starting with a player, then a ball, then a shot. Other cards, like blockers, can affect the quality of the shot. Some shots succeed, and are worth points. Others fail, and are worth nothing. The highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game!<br/><br/>Fightball was released as three sets of double decks, and any two decks can be played against one another.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Ship movement is Newtonian and three-dimensional: (X,Y) and (X,Z) position charts are used to track where the ships are at any given time.  Players spend ship points to buy ship components and technology points to buy improved technologies; victory points are earned for destroying pods and ships and for being the last player to have ships in play. When all of one player's ships have been destroyed or warped out, the player with the highest victory point total wins.<br/><br/>Four scenarios are suggested with differing allowed technologies and different numbers of starting ship and technology points.

4370,Fische Fluppen Frikadellen,"['Multiple Maps', 'Pick-up and Deliver']",['Economic'],"What a fuss. The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.<br/><br/>In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!<br/><br/>Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.<br/><br/>The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.<br/><br/>At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.<br/><br/>You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Obviously enough, the last man (or woman, or team) standing wins. Reminiscent of &quot;Frag,&quot; but with more complicated mechanisms.<br/><br/>The modular boards are square grids on the same scale as most of Jolly Roger's other games; in fact, the boards for &quot;Orcs at the Gates&quot; and &quot;Maul of America&quot; can be used with this game.<br/><br/>Approximate playing time is totally arbitrary; it will vary depending on the number of players, the size of the playing area, and so forth.

Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies).

It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)<br/><br/>Historical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.<br/><br/>",1680,,,

This collection brings together three of the finest, covering three very different aspects of the Roman Empire: Hannibal versus Rome, Imperium and Circus Maximus.<br/><br/>Hannibal versus Rome is a 30-minute two-player game depicing the initial struggle for supremacy between Rome and Carthage, which finally established Rome as the leading power in the Mediterranean. It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.<br/><br/>The map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.<br/><br/>Imperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.<br/><br/>In each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.<br/><br/>Chariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.<br/><br/>Each of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish. The first to bring all three across the finish line wins the game and the laurel wreath.<br/><br/>Note: the 3 games in this were previously released in Neue Spiele im alten Rom.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store, and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>In this two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks comprising domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.<br/><br/>In this first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.<br/><br/>The Odin's Ravens (Second Edition) transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Loki deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire. Whoever reaches the end of the world first wins.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

One player controls Princess Gloriana and her entourage, who are trying to get from the North East corner of the map to the Holy City in the South West, where Gloriana's coronation will take place. Gloriana is escorted by cyborgs, Amazons, and Imperial Guardsmen, and is watched over from afar by the magic-using Guardians in the Holy City. The other player controls Aemulatio, the sister of the dead king, who is trying to capture and sacrifice Gloriana in order to seize the throne herself. Aemulatio fields mutants, gargoyles, and a pair of Necromancers (amusingly named Kcud and Nootrac) against Gloriana's forces.<br/><br/>Playing time is listed as &quot;2 - 3 hour(s)&quot; on the cover, but the rules declare there is no time limit. For Gloriana to win, she must reach the Holy City or totally rout Aemulatio's minions; for Aemulatio to win, her forces need only capture Gloriana (even if Aemulatio and her Necromancers are all dead, which would be a very Pyrrhic victory).<br/><br/>A six-sided die (not included) is required to resolve combat, and also to allow the Necromancers to cast one spell with random effects once per turn, and the Guardians to cast one spell each of &quot;Mind and Magic&quot; per turn.<br/><br/>The lurid cover art by R.

It was included in the Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Issue #103.<br/><br/>The May 16, 1863 Battle of Champion Hill was the largest, bloodiest, and most significant action of Grant&rsquo;s Vicksburg Campaign. 32,000 advancing Union soldiers met 23,000 Confederates in a fierce struggle for a vital crossroads roughly halfway between Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi. The field was dominated by bald Champion Hill, from which Confederate artillery opened fire on the Union army at 9:45 A.M. The first Federal assault on the hill drove the Southerners back with bayonets and clubbed muskets. As the Union soldiers tried to reform and consolidate their gains, they were swept away by a counterattack led by John Bowen&rsquo;s Missourians and Arkansans. Ulysses S. Grant ordered more men towards the hill and Bowen&rsquo;s Confederates were themselves driven off, compelling a general retreat. Southern Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman was killed while directing a desperate rearguard action that enabled most of the Confederate army to escape towards Vicksburg. The decisive Union victory at Champion Hill was instrumental in forcing the Confederates out of the open field and into a doomed position inside the walls of Vicksburg.<br/><br/>Brief summary of rules:<br/>Stacking:<br/>&bull; Up to 2 units may stack, unless optional stacking rule is used, which allows 5 units in one hex, as long as only one is of brigade level or higher.<br/>&bull; Units in a stack must attack the same target.

The attacking units may enter the cavalry unit&rsquo;s vacated hex, but they may not select an alternate target.<br/><br/>Attacker Effectiveness (&ldquo;Ar&rdquo; results):<br/>&bull; Attackers forced to retreat are flipped to their ineffective side.  Attackers remain ineffective until a night turn.  (Retreating defenders remain effective.)<br/>&bull; Ineffective units may not attack, i.e., they may not enter EZOC.  Ineffective units that begin their side&rsquo;s combat phase in an EZOC must retreat.<br/><br/>Retreats/Advances:<br/>&bull; Units may not retreat off the map or through EZOC.<br/>&bull; One unit of a stack may retreat one hex to make room for another unit retreating into its hex (displacement)<br/>&bull; Any unit that cannot retreat is eliminated.<br/>&bull; A unit that participates in an attack/defense resulting in a hex being cleared of enemy units (i.e., the enemy retreated or was eliminated) may advance into that hex.<br/>&bull; Artillery may not advance after combat.<br/><br/>Artillery Range Fire:<br/>&bull; Artillery may attack units within 3 hexes.

Individual players are rated for their ability to throw, catch, run, block, rush the passer, etc. Players are the coach for their team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.  The game rules also cover kickoffs, punts, turnovers, penalties, etc.<br/><br/>The basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. A strong team will usually overwhelm a weaker team, though good playcalling and some luck with the cards can mitigate that advantage. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. The game includes optional endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them.

To gain advantage, princes vied with each other to collect powerful magic amulets called Dragonstones.<br/>Like many royals, over time the princes began to prefer the comfort and safety of their fortified castles. Rather than risk their own lives by venturing out to search for these amulets, they paid handsome rewards to those who could bring them stones.

Two family games: Cancellation and Dice Deck Rummy, two children's games: Give And Take and Crazy Dice, two casino games (you will have to supply the betting chips): Three Card Down and Make My Point, two strategy games: Pathfinder and Admiral, and two solitary games: Dice Deck Bingo and Stack 'Em Up.<br/><br/>To give but one example, in Dice Deck Rummy you are dealt 8 cards.  On your turn, you draw a card from the stock or the top discard.  You then roll two dice.  You can play any sets of the number rolled (two or more cards of that value), or any runs (three or more same color cards that follow each other in sequence) that end or begin with the number rolled (counting the dice as an extra card).  Finally you discard.  You can also freely increase played sets and runs on your turn.  First player to go out scores the total value remaining in the other players' hands.<br/><br/>Dice Deck is similar to the Deck of Dice<br/><br/>",1987,,,

4476,Electronic Talking Hot Potato,[],"['Action / Dexterity', ""Children's Game"", 'Party Game', 'Real-time']","A high-pressure game of getting rid of a &quot;hot&quot; potato so as not to be holding it when time runs out.<br/><br/>This game probably goes way back. Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which &quot;a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:<br/><br/>Jack's alive, and likely to live<br/>If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.<br/><br/>The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.&quot;<br/><br/>That was written in 1888.<br/><br/>Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.<br/><br/>By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &ldquo;Spudsie,&rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &ldquo;Chip O&rsquo;Grattin.&rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo;<br/><br/>",1988,,,

4479,Le Fortuniste,"['Auction/Bidding', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Economic'],"Known in French as &quot;Le fortuniste&quot;, Ratrace is all about social success. You start out in life with $200, a Credit Card and a Business in the Working Class (outer ring of the board) and your objective is to get into the Middle Class and eventually High Society (inner ring). You'll have to face the usual: running your business, paying taxes, getting an education, joining social clubs and much more. You win by retiring with $100 000.<br/><br/>With six players, all businesses in the game start owned; with less players, the Treasury owns the remaining businesses. When playing with two or three, each player can own two sets of businesses at start. The businesses sell various Status Symbols (required to move up in society) in addition to &quot;Other Purchases&quot;. Credit can be used to buy things --the cards have no limit, but whenever you land on a Credit Due square you must pay the card off entirely, plus 10% interest. Bankruptcy means you start all over again.<br/><br/>You can win up to 3 different status symbols at a time, and you cannot buy one of a class lower than your own. Money comes in through a payoff/salary square on each class ring (and a few other windfall squares), and changes hands with purchases in a zero-sum fashion.<br/><br/>To enter the Middle Class, you must have $500, three status symbols and either a Night School diploma or a Country Club membership. Or you can marry. Status symbols now beneath you must be auctioned off. High Society requires $3000, 3 status symbols, and either a University diploma or a Yacht Club membership. Or marry again. The risk with marriage is that you may end up on a Divorce square...<br/><br/>From a Waddington ad dated 1976:  &quot;A macho game of Social Climbing - Do you have what it takes to be a success? Start with $200 in the working class. Then try to make it to the Middle Class and High Society. You'll have to face all of life's anxiety's along the way, but there is always the chance of making it rich! Get in the Ratrace! You'll bite and claw your way to the top. You'll never know when you might need the skills this game will teach you  -  in real life!&quot;<br/><br/>",1967,,,

4482,Winchester,['Roll / Spin and Move'],['Racing'],"Winchester is a race game where the players score points by getting their pawns around a rectangular track the fastest. Each player gets 3 to 5 pawns (based on the number of players) which are placed on a 4 by 4 starting grid.  The track is four squares wide. During the setup, the players randomly cover some of these squares with wooden blocks to provide obstacles that prevent movement. The location of the blocks is determined by several die rolls.  This random setup provides for a different track each race.<br/><br/>Movement of the players' pawns is controlled by a special six sided chess die. The die contains the six basic chess pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn. Each turn a player will roll the chess die to determine everyone's move for that turn.  Once all players have moved, the next player on the left rolls the die for the next round. When moving, the player must move one of his pieces based on the indicated chess piece.  Like chess, the player may not move off the edge of the board or over one of the obstacles, except for the knight move.  If the player captures one of the piece of another player, the two pieces exchange positions.<br/><br/>The first piece to cross the finish line scores 15 points with each successive piece scoring one less (14, 13, 12, etc).  There are small bonuses for certain finishing conditions (first to have all pieces finish, three positions in a row, etc).<br/><br/>The game comes with a rolled up, laminated board, 25 pawns, 24 wooden blocks for obstacles, one normal die and one chess die.<br/><br/>",1990,,,
4483,The Buntu Circus,['Pattern Building'],['Abstract Strategy'],"The Buntu Circus was independently published by a group of UK gamers calling themselves The Buntu Circus. It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.<br/><br/>A deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.<br/><br/>In turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.<br/><br/>The idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.<br/><br/>There are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the &quot;power&quot; colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player &quot;hoops&quot; the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a &quot;lock&quot; on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four &quot;draw&quot; decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of &quot;stacking&quot; the deck with particular colours or symbols.<br/><br/>The quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags. Very satisfying to &quot;hoop&quot; your rows with.<br/><br/>",1997,,,

The whole thing is in the middle of an octagon, with the edges used for storage of the 80 colored pegs.<br/><br/>Each player starts with ten pegs of a color.  Each player places a peg in turn in the inner grid.  You are eliminated if: a) you have two pegs (of your color) in the same row, column or diagonal; b) you take more than a minute to place a peg; or c) you seek help from a non-player!  Once the inner grid is complete, play continues/repeats with the outer grid (you remove a peg from the inner grid and place it in the outer).<br/><br/>Optionally, the last player can try to finish placing all 80 pegs whilst respecting the exclusion rule.<br/><br/>Note that the outer grid is actually harder to solve because of the 4x4 hole in its middle.<br/><br/>",1985,,,

4487,Silk Road,"['Dice Rolling', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement']","['Economic', 'Medieval']","A game of trading on the Silk Road. Each player is a merchant who travels from city to city buying and selling ten different goods in an effort to turn their starting 20 units of money into 10,000.<br/><br/>The map is divided into nine regions each of which has a &quot;price index&quot; which is tracked on a erasable tile. Each merchant has a sliding paper device which lets them easily look up the current price of each good for a given price index. After buying goods in a region the region's price index changes, which may have unexpected effects; each good will push the index up or down depending on which direction increases the price for that good, but all purchase effects in a region are added together to produce the final effect. And, since the index determines the prices for all goods, buying one good can cause the prices of all ten goods to change. Selling goods has the same effect, applied in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>The game represents the limited communication of the era by only letting players see the price index for the region they are in (and then only when in a city). Players cannot sell goods in the same region they bought them in for two turns, so information inevitably gets stale. Players can sell or trade each other information as well as goods.<br/><br/>In addition to goods players can purchase animals, rent ships, and hire armies and guides. Animals let the player move faster and carry more goods; ships naturally allow sea movement and can carry an unlimited number of goods. Armies protect against bandit/pirate attacks, which are one of the types of random events rolled for every turn. Other random events can include war (guides help you avoid wars), epidemics, and getting married; marriage gives the merchant a family which does nothing useful, but you can sell goods for more money in your in-law's city. Some events can also change the price indices.<br/><br/>",1985,,,

In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.<br/><br/>In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game.

4554,Phalanx,[],"['Abstract Strategy', 'Ancient']","This chess-like variant is themed around the military formations used by the Ancient Greeks. Each player has 15 identical pieces that are set up on opposite sides of the board, which is comprised of an 8 x 8 playing field of squares that is further divided diagonally in alternate fashion (see picture). Pieces are comprised of: 8 small triangles of various orientation (Auxiliaries), 4 squares (Archers), which are the size of two Auxiliaries, 2 Hoplites (which are the size of an Archer with a Auxiliary on top), and 1 Syntagma, a larger triangle (the size of 2 Auxiliaries combined). Since each piece must always be oriented to face it's owner (diagram for set-up is printed on the board), you'll find that some pieces are not interchangeable with others of the same type (like Hoplites and Auxiliaries). This is important as all movement is done by moving pieces diagonally, horizontally or vertically along paths that are not blocked and the piece must end on a space where the board outline matches his piece.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture or &quot;Phalanx&quot; your opponents pieces - not by jumping (Checkers) or by taking it's place on the board (Chess), but by surrounding it on two of it's sides with your pieces. A multiple Phalanx attack is possible if a move surrounds several of his opponents pieces with a single move. When 14 of a players 15 pieces are captured, that player can no longer win and is eliminated. Tied or games that are a draw (you can play to a time limit as well) are determined by the value of each players remaining pieces, which are from 5 - 20 points each.<br/><br/>",1964,,,

The first player to get one of their rabbits to the other side wins.<br/><br/>This may sound like a simple kids' game, and while it is easy enough for your kids to learn and enjoy, you will find that it is also a very deep game that can take a lifetime to master. Arimaa is one of the deepest strategy games ever invented in the history of mankind, but designed to look intuitively simple. No two games of Arimaa are ever the same. There is much to learn and discover about this intuitively simple, yet intellectually challenging, game.<br/><br/>Played on an 8x8 grid with four trap squares and 32 animal pieces (16 gold and 16 silver). Each player has an elephant, a camel, 2 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 8 rabbits. Strength hierarchy: Elephant &gt; Camel &gt; Horse &gt; Dog &gt; Cat &gt; Rabbit. The game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces first in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on seventh and eighth ranks. Then gold moves its pieces first. A player can move up to four &quot;steps&quot; each turn. All pieces move orthogonally (at right angles).<br/><br/>Arimaa was invented by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Syed was inspired by Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue to design a new game that could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand. (Arimaa is Aamir spelled backwards plus an initial &quot;a&quot;). In 2002, Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

4642,Pennant Race,['Dice Rolling'],"['Dice', 'Sports']","Tabletop baseball simulation game.<br/><br/>In 1971, Time Inc (owner of Sports Illustrated magazine) published their first baseball game, titled Sports Illustrated Major League Baseball.  It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.<br/><br/>Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.<br/><br/>The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to The Avalon Hill Game Co when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted The Avalon Hill Game Co the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any The Avalon Hill Game Co sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.<br/><br/>Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.<br/><br/>",1972,,,

4650,Across the Board,"['Auction/Bidding', 'Betting and Bluffing']","['Animals', 'Dice', 'Racing', 'Sports']","Players choose which of the four racetracks will be used for the game. Each player is handed a copy of the appropriate race form (which should be studied!). The eleven racehorses, which are numbered two through twelve, are randomized and are bought, one at a time, by the players in an open auction. Money spent in the auction will be brought back into the game during the third, fifth and eighth races.<br/><br/>Eight races make a complete game and each follows the same procedure. Each player, in turn, has the option to make as many bets as one wants but each bet is made &ldquo;across the board.&rdquo; All bets are made in 150-skin (the game&rsquo;s monetary unit) increments: 50 to win, 50 to place and 50 to show. After everyone has placed their bets, the money is divided as equally as possible into seven stacks.<br/><br/>After all bets have been placed, the race is run. A horse has completed a circuit of the track when five Xs have been placed next to it. Sometimes horses begin with some Xs and sometimes the favorites, horses 6, 7 and 8, need an extra X.<br/>When a player rolls the dice, that player may give the horse rolled an X and pass on the dice or give that horse a / (half-X) and roll again to that horse an X. When three horses have finished the race, the owner(s) of the winning horse and winning bettors are paid. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Across the Board features a pari-mutual betting system to mimic a real racetrack. There are no fixed odds. The winners win what the losers lost. That makes Across the Board unique among horse racing games.<br/><br/>",1975,,,
4651,Stalingrad,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio / Combat Results Table', 'Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control']","['Wargame', 'World War II']","The original edition came out in 1963 in a double-size box. The large box was nearly twice the area of a traditional AH box. Later the game came out in a traditional-size box.  A second edition with clarified rules was issued in 1974 with the same standard size box but thinner.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly straightforward.  The strategies are extremely deep. Stalingrad is by far the most thoroughly and deeply analyzed board war game.  Furthermore, the game preserves interest for players at a wide range of levels. Stalingrad is a good game to use to introduce players to hex-based war games.<br/><br/>Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one hex) or retreat (two hexes) after combat.  Units have one-hex thick zones of control; movement directly from one hex in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining hex of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one hex per turn movement), mountains (one hex per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten hex movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns, but I have never heard of this being done between normal players.<br/><br/>Several extremely bad German strategic plans are in wide use.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 2<br/><br/>",1963,,,

Knock your opponents dice out of play in the basic game, or develop unique combinations to expel dicers to the dungeon in the advanced game. For ages 5 years and over.&quot;<br/><br/>The dicers game is played with collectible dice. These have 5 clear sides, with a figure representing the character inside of the dice. The sixth side is solid, and shows the name of the die, its &quot;casting number&quot;, its special ability, and its affiliations. The clear sides are numbered from 1 to 5, while the solid face is the '6'. Each die represents a character or item from the Harry Potter stories.<br/><br/>The starter set includes 6 dice; Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, Hagrid, and the Sorting Hat. It also includes a sheet of rules.<br/>The rules actually have 3 levels of play described in them. The basic game only uses the casting numbers on the dice. The Intermediate game adds in the abilities of the dice, and different areas of play, and the advanced game adds in the affiliations of the dice, and reserve abilities.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players set out the six dice and each take turns picking one to determine which dice they will use. Players then roll to see who goes first (the &quot;Challenger&quot;).<br/>The challenger picks one die, and then the defender picks on of their dice.<br/>The challenger may roll the die a number of times up to its Casting number, looking for as high a roll as possible. Only the last roll made counts, even if it is lower than a previous roll.<br/>The defender does the same with his or her die.<br/>The lower roll is expelled (removed from play) and the winner becomes the new challenger. This is repeated until only one player has dice left.<br/><br/>In the Intermediate game, there are three areas of play. All dice begin in the Field. A losing die is placed in the dungeon, where it cannot be used. A winning die is placed in the Keep. Dice in the keep cannot be used until a player has no dice left in the field, at which point all of the dice in that player's Keep are moved into the Field. The winning die can choose to either expel the losing die to the dungeon, or to just place it in the Keep and activate the special ability of the winning die. One side of the rules lists the different special abilities. A few examples include:<br/>Capture, which lets you take the enemy die and use its special powers as well as your own.<br/>Summon, which lets you retrieve a die that has been placed in the dungeon.<br/>Swap, which lets you trade the locations of two of a player's dice.<br/>The game ends when one player's dice are all in the dungeon or captured.<br/><br/>In the Advanced game, you can use the affiliations on the dice. The affiliations include the four houses, creatures, and wizards. For every die with the same affiliation as your chosen die in your Field, your die gains +1 to its casting number. This level of the game also adds reserve abilities. These are special powers that, when activated, have no immediate effect but allow the die to be set aside in 'Reserve' and activated later.<br/><br/>Extra dice are sold as single dice. The die you are buying is clearly displayed on the outside of the packaging.<br/><br/>The packaging stated that there were &quot;54 characters to collect&quot; but only 36 were released.<br/><br/>There were two 'Starter Packs' with 6 dice each and 24 individual dicers.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell &ldquo;Proclaim!&rdquo;, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a &quot;unique&quot; bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.

It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Pary&quot; line in 1987.<br/><br/>Episode: Mystery of the Mislaid Egg<br/><br/>Faberge: The Man and the Egg <br/>Peter Carl Faberge was born in 1846 and died in 1920. The Russian achieved fame by designing dazzling fantasies in gold and silver, set with precious stones and further decorated with brilliant enamel work. After winning a medal at the Pan-Russian Exhibition in 1882, his work attracted the attention of the Tsar. This ultimately led to the creation of the series of Imperial Easter Eggs. Faberge's eggs were first commissioned in 1886 by Tsar Alexander III, for his wife, Maria Feodorovna. The tradition continued with Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra.<br/><br/>The Plot: Imperial Russia is about to collapse. Members of the Pahlov family, cousins of the Tsar, are clinging to the tattered shreds of Imperial privilege. Shortly after the Peasant Circus celebration, the family's prized Imperial Faberge Easter Egg was discovered missing. The family regards the egg as a symbol of legitimacy and social status.<br/><br/>The Time: March 1917<br/><br/>The Place: Petrograd, Russia<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Vladimir Pahlov: Head of the House of Pahlov and disgraced military leader. Vladimir led 300,000 men during the Battle of East Prussia in 1915, but couldn't find a fourth for a game of bridge when it was over. He currently courts peasant girls and designs Petrograd's defense for the impending Red invasion.<br/><br/>Natasha Pahlov: Wildly eccentric grand dame of the House of Pahlov, wife of Vladimir, and possessor of the largest shoe collection in Mother Russia. Natasha believes that the shoes vie for social position and partake in scandalous gossip. As a result, the footwear is constantly monitored and rearranged in the Imperial Shoe Chamber.<br/><br/>Lord Peter Welthrop: Natasha's half-brother and second cousin. Welthrop has lived in the House of Pahlov for the past six months. A native of London, he fled to Russia after running his father's bank into the ground. Destitute and confused, Peter spends most of his time in the Imperial Sable Yard, poking the animals with sticks and watching them bare their teeth.<br/><br/>Ludwina Pahlov: Beautiful and manipulative daughter of Vladimir and Natasha. Ludwina has persuaded the family to adhere to the practice of Khlysty (Flagellants). Flagellants believe that a person must sin and repent before he or she can become closer to God. This belief inspired the Pahlov family tradition of the Peasant Circus. This bimonthly event calls for the humiliation of invited peasant &quot;guests&quot;.<br/><br/>Grigory Yamovich: Disheveled yet hypnotic mystic. Invited home by the adoring Ludwina, Grigory became the guest who wouldn't go away. Besides indoctrinating Ludwina with the nuances of Khlysty, he ensured his &quot;usefulness&quot; within the House of Pahlov by seemingly curing sickly sables through hypnotism.<br/><br/>Zudnyet the Dung Hauler: Preferred peasant of Natasha. Zudnyet is keeper of the Imperial Compost Pile and overseer of the Imperial Beet Patch. He invariably sits beside Natasha during the Peasant Circus celebrations, clad in sable furs. Zudnyet is often summoned to Natasha's chambers for late-night discourses concerning man and God.<br/><br/>Olga Grimach: Lady-in waiting to Natasha and a woman of true inner strength. Most of Olga's time is spent as shoe organizer for Natasha's sometimes &quot;animated&quot; footwear collection. When not soothing soles, Olga writes eternally senseless poetry for a lover no one has ever seen.<br/><br/>Tatiana Mikhapolov: Sister of Vladimir and chief rival of Grigory. Tatiana is constantly trying to drive Grigory from the House of Pahlov in hopes of curbing the family's slide into a moral abyss. She poisoned his tea, dropped glowing embers in his shorts, and pushed him out a third story window-all to no avail. Grigory loves the attention.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>24 Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>",1987,,,

It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Party&quot; line beginning in 1987.<br/><br/>Episode: Who Killed Roger Ellington?<br/><br/>The Plot: Post-war America was thriving in 1948, as was murder in a small Massachusetts town. Industrialist Roger Ellington was cut-down in the prime of his sordid life. After eating a plate of snails, he succumbed to what appeared to be a most deadly strain of indigestion.<br/><br/>The Time: Aug. 9, 1948<br/><br/>The Place: Washington Station, Massachusetts<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Major Deegan: Lifetime resident of Washington Station. Deegan was Roger's chief competitor for women, status &ndash; everything for as long as anyone could remember. A well-trained mercenary, Deegan returned to town shortly after the war, satisfied that he and a few others had saved theWestern world from evil. He couldn't remember where he was the night of Roger's death.<br/><br/>Derrick Ellington: Stepbrother of the deceased, had been away in the Merchant Marines for ten years, returning to town a year ago. Derrick became engaged to Sara Admunson after his return. She died shortly after in an auto accident. A drunken Roger was driving her home from a party when he lost control of the car. Derrick crawled into a bottle shortly after the funeral and never came out. Always looked down upon by his brother, Derrick never &quot;lived up&quot; to the Ellington name. Perhaps that is why he sought refuge in the Merchant Marines for all those years. He couldn't remember where he was the evening of the murder.<br/><br/>Cybil Admunson: Sister of the late Sara. It was common knowledge that Cybil loved Roger. A social climber, Cybil was not liked by many. At her sister's funeral she exchanged some pretty harsh words with Roger. While deciding on which college to attend next, she worked as hostess at L'Escargot. She was on duty that night.<br/><br/>Arnold Green: Boston College student working at L'Escargot for the summer. Green was not a born waiter, and was publicly humiliated by Roger on several occasions. Green served that evening.<br/><br/>Yvonne Drake: Master pastry chef at L'Escargot, she came from Paris shortly after the war. A cold &quot;foreigner&quot;, she did not mix easily with the locals. However, she was having a rather obvious affair with Steve Watson. Yvonne was in and out of the kitchen all evening.<br/><br/>Steve Watson: Young, energetic man who come from Boston in 1946. Steve was well liked and was Roger's business partner in many deals. He was president of the local Chamber of Commerce. He dined with Roger and Gastonne that evening.<br/><br/>Gastonne Schmidt: Owner and head chef of L'Escargot. Since his arrival from Paris a year and a half ago, Schmidt had become known as an arrogant yet likable eccentric. He gave the town a bit of European class, and his gruffness only added atmosphere to his establishment in the eyes of the townspeople. He dined with Roger that evening.<br/><br/>Katie LaFemme: Local party girl with the proverbial heart of gold. Having had a painful on-again-off-again affair with Roger, Katie knew of his dark disposition. She once bellowed from her roost in Jerry's Bar, &quot;Someone ought to put him out of my misery!&quot; She also couldn't remember where she was that evening.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>24 Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>",1982,,,

Players are dealt Passport and Travel cards at the beginning of the game and pay the Customs Fund (bank) the value of those cards.  Players then take turns moving their pawns around the board.  If they land on a city space, they pay the indicated amount to the owner(s) of the passport(s) for that city.  Landing on other types of spaces results in various actions like drawing a Customs card, spinning the world spinner, and moving off-course.<br/><br/>The winner is the person with the most money when the game ends.  The game ends when a player completes both legs of the course and lands on the &quot;home&quot; space.

There are 12 spies on the train as well as the detectives Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The players take turns moving the detectives and the spies around the train and keeping track of their movements. Every 8 turns (8 hours in the game) they check their notes and determine which spies have been killed. A spy is killed if it is ever a) alone in a compartment or corridor square for 1 or more hours, b) a second spy enters the compartment or corridor square and c) the spy is never in the same compartment or square as one of the detectives afterwards. Since the status of a spy is not determined until turn 8 (or 16 or 24) it is possible to move a spy, which is already &quot;dead&quot;. This spy cannot kill other spies even if it fulfills the conditions above. Since the status of a spy depends entirely on their movement it is important for the players to keep careful notes and to be able to defend their logic to the other players.<br/><br/>",1967,,,

The game has undergone a number of changes and additions over the years, but basically layout and game play has stayed the same.<br/><br/>In some versions, the Bowler figure has a long tilting 'chute' that the ball rolls down after pushing on the bowlers arm. In others the figure is spring loaded and pressing a lever makes the figure 'throw' the ball, with a setting for fast or slow bowling. The balls themselves have changed from small metal ball bearings to two sizes/weights - for both variety in play and for easier game play for younger players.<br/>The Batsman figure in some editions has a string with which you pull back the bat to release it to hit the ball, others have a slide mechanism and some have a trigger mechanism to move the bat. <br/>The fielding player figures are a variety of colours in different versions and may be white, yellow or blue. Additionally in a couple of versions (like Super Cricket) they had magnetic bases to further help 'field' the ball.  <br/>The player figures in one version (One Day Cricket) came entirely unpainted and could be painted the colours of your favourite teams. Later editions include an actual Wicket Keeper figure rather than a 'W' shape part of the batter mechanism.<br/><br/>The playing 'field' also has changed shape and fabric. In some editions it is very thin light fabric (and in older games, the flocking on the underside completely disintegrates and moults off!) in others it is thicker, crease resistant neoprene. The boundary 'fence' is either white L shaped angled plastic flat or picket shaped strips with green joiner pieces or in more recent versions, a simple rope length.<br/><br/>In the different versions players can simulate a one-day international, a Twenty/20 series or a full five-day test match. <br/>As well as being featured on box graphics, some well known cricket players have even lent their names to some versions, like Freddie Truman, Mike Atherton, AB De Villiers &amp; Jonty Rhodes.<br/><br/>It is very difficult to date many of the earlier games accurately as there are no dates on the boxes (very annoying). The date '1977' on the included rule sheet ACTUALLY refers to the copyright date of the ORIGINAL games release by Peter Pan Playthings and NOT that particular versions release. Guesstimates can be made by the box imagery, design and playing piece inclusions.<br/><br/><br/>World Cup Cricket is touted as &quot;The original action-packed table-top cricket game!&quot; for Ages 4 and up.<br/>In the box (decorated with action shots of late 80s / early 90s players including Alec Stewart and Jack Russell) comes with a green beize (?? beige) playing area which is laid out on a table, with six boundary fence sections which Velcro around the edge to act as the boundary and prevent the ball flying off around the room. The batsman attached at one end and the bowler to the other.<br/><br/>The pitch (although octagonal) resembles an archery target -the closer to the boundary and further from the batsmen, the higher the ring value. Directly in front of the batsmen is an area worth no runs, outside of that 1 run, then a ring worth 2 runs and the outer area worth 3 runs. Hitting the fence gets 4 runs and there are four small areas jutting out of the boundary worth 6 runs.<br/><br/>The bowling player places fielders (with a catching 'cup' between their legs) around the field in an attempt to 'catch' the batsman out. Bowling is achieved by loading the ball into the bowler's cupped hand and pushing down on the front arm, causing the ball to roll down a ramp towards the batsman.<br/><br/>The batsman is controlled with cord attached to the bat. The batting player pulls back the cord, releasing it in time to hit the approaching ball. Whichever area the ball is hit to is the number of runs the player gets.<br/>Batsmen can be out by being caught by the bowler, by hitting the ball between the legs of the fielders into their 'cups', by the ball hitting the stumps behind the batsmen or by the batsman edging the ball into the &quot;wicket keeper&quot; which is attached to the batting stand.<br/><br/>There are earlier versions of the game where the batting action is different and the players less detailed.<br/><br/>",1977,,,
4785,Mysteries by Vincent: Case of the Wirst Case Scenario,['Role Playing'],"['Deduction', 'Murder/Mystery']","How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>The Case of the Wirst Case Scenario<br/><br/>A murder mystery party game for 10<br/>That magnate of the publishing world, Mr. William Rudolph Wirst, President &amp; CEO of Wirst Publishing, has invited you to attend a very special celebratory dinner to be held at the Hi-8 Hotel, Midtown Manhattan, New York. After dinner, Mr. Wirst will unveil the latest title soon-to-be published by his company: It was the Wirst of Times, It was the Best of Times. The manuscript, of course, is Mr. Wirst's own memoirs, and he promises to regale everyone with excerpts - information that some might even consider, well . . . shall we say . . . scandalous? Incriminating? Surely it will be a night to live on in the memories of all who live through it . . .<br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/>P. Leigh Jerreyes is an RN by trade, and new to the world of writing. She is a budding author who has written her first book of poems entitled, &quot;Bedpans and Betadine.&quot; She's brought her manuscript with her, hoping to convince Mr. Wirst to publish it. After all, her creative writing teacher told her she was raw with talent and wide-eyed with wonder. Leigh herself modestly dismisses such praise, saying &quot;I only want to pursue one of my greatest dreams in life.&quot; She wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Lilla &quot;Li&quot; Belle S. Lander is a media darling whose articles have been published in every major newspaper across the country. Flashy and charismatic, Li is an award-winning journalist whose written words spark controversy and terror in even the most sedate circles. She is also hoping to sell her first book-length Washington expose': The Hussies in the House. Li often wears business suits or professional clothing.<br/><br/>Allyssa T. Fairre is easily the most successful tabloid writer in the country. Her work of tracking down Elvis-impersonating extra-terrestrials has brought her a great deal of notoriety. Suave, elegant and chic, she is known to turn up anywhere around the globe in pursuit of a story. Never married, she claims to be in search of the &quot;right rich man for a husband.&quot; Yet she rarely lacks handsome male escorts, and often wears rather revealing attire.<br/><br/>Starr Cross is the epitome of the &quot;femme fatale&quot; romance writer and her books have long topped the romance charts. Her latest titles, The Letches of Lidgefield County and Lust Knows No Bounds, have sold well over twelve million copies worldwide. Yet hers is a rags to riches story: Starr worked as a cocktail waitress before selling her first book. Her rise to the top was the equivalent of a bungi jump in reverse. In the publishing industry she is considered to be a hot property, frequently sought after by other houses and literary agencies. Starr prefers clothes with ribbons and ruffles.<br/><br/>Lowe Z. Ajante is a used car salesman turned literary agent who is sure his hard work will pay off soon. He believes in good old American free enterprise, waving his stars and stripes in the faces of pouting pessimists. He knows his attempts to constantly upgrade his stable of authors will eventually bring him fame and fortune. Lowe is a flamboyant dresser who believes polyester double-knit has taken a bad rap, and is sure it will make a comeback any day now.<br/><br/>Murray &quot;Mur&quot; DerMisteree is an internationally famous writer of mystery novels, second only to Agatha Christie. Though some say he has far surpassed the Queen of Crime, as he is critically acclaimed for the realism of his work. &quot;Makes you feel like you're right there committing the crime,&quot; says the L.A. Whines. Personally, Mr. DerMisteree has been described as a brooding intellectual, a genius in his genre. He frequently wears his hunting clothes.<br/><br/>Pickford &quot;Pick&quot; E. Publichere is a new publisher who has recently released a number of trendy titles, including - The Mother-in-Law Excuse Book: A Guide to Avoiding Holiday Hassles and Other Traumas. He has been described by Kiss Up Now magazine as a calculating, competitive entrepreneur, sure to make it big. His closest colleagues call him &quot;Pick,&quot; while the thousands of writers who receive his rejection letters each year refer to him by different names. Pick always wears business suits.<br/><br/>Ray Gene Bull is an award-winning sportswriter who enjoys traveling to remote parts of the world in search of little-known sporting events. Thus he is known in professional circles as the &quot;Mr. National Geographic&quot; of the sports world. Physically fit and ruggedly handsome, Ray is a former quarterback for Poedunck University. He is as popular with members of the opposite sex as he is with his readers. Ray prefers clothes that display sports logos.<br/><br/>Portia &quot;Por&quot; Rytere is a literary novelist whose mixed metaphors are often only understood by MENSA members, and whose analogies are so deep that one must reread her books many times to grasp the hidden meaning. Her latest seven-hundred page novel, And Then They Died, is a fictitious rendition of the mating rituals of tsetse flies, and like her other books, is published by Wirst Publishing. Por is the past president of Superior Novelists of Balderdash, or SNOB, and the ex-wife of Richard Rytere. Elegant eveningwear usually comprises her wardrobe.<br/><br/>Richard &quot;Rich&quot; Rytere is sometimes called the King of Commercialism, having capitalized on the &quot;quick read.&quot; One of Wirst Publishing's hottest authors, Rich's books have yet to miss the bestsellers lists. His latest novel, Life, Love, and Rain Falling Silently on the Mountaintop, is bound to be his greatest work yet. But fame and fortune have not changed Rich - he's still the same fun-loving guy from Philly, who prefers hot dogs to filet mignon. He owns a wide collection of flashy ties.<br/><br/>Ever wonder what it would be like to be a famous author? Here's your chance to play one for the evening! Why don't you try on fame and fortune and see what it feels like?<br/><br/>This mystery is probably the easiest ten-person mystery game to put on. Since the setting is modern day, the costumes are usually something a person finds in their closet.<br/><br/>So have fun, and while you're at it, sign a few autographs for your adoring fans!<br/><br/>",1996,,,

Once time is up, players score their words.  They then close the lid to their box, gently shake it so that the words are mixed up but the letters remain the same, and then pass it to their opponent.  Players then reset the timer and again arrange words from the letter cubes, essentially trying to do a better job of it than their opponent since they are using the same letters.  Highest combined score from both rounds wins.<br/><br/>Cube List:<br/>(note that letters are arranged differently on the red and black dice, but each die will have a letter set match)<br/>W4,P4,Y4,M3,U3,O1<br/>H3,N2,R2,T2,E1,O1<br/>L2,R2,T2,I2,E1,O1<br/>J6,D3,N2,R2,E1,A1<br/>Q8,G4,F4,L2,I2,A1<br/>W4,V4,D3,T2,E1,A1<br/>B4,M3,U3,N2,S2,O1<br/>X8,B4,Y4,S2,E1,A1<br/>H3,T2,L2,S2,E1,A1<br/>K5,C4,V4,U3,N2,O1<br/>Z10,C4,F4,I2,E1,A1<br/>D3,S2,R2,I2,E1,*<br/>P4,G4,M3,I2,E1,*<br/><br/>",1976,,,
4792,Big Mini: Flohspiel,['Flicking'],"['Action / Dexterity', ""Children's Game""]","Tiddledy Winks varies based on publisher, but they all generally have a cup or other container that sits in the center of a target.  The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the &quot;winks&quot;) into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the &quot;tiddledy&quot;) so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).<br/><br/>Wikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter. As early as 1890, Jacques boxes included a label warning of &quot;worthless imitations... issued by unscrupulous and jealous persons&quot;, and its rules threatened that &quot;proceedings will be taken against any one infringing the Proprietors' Rights in this Game&quot;.<br/><br/>",1888,,,

What makes this game a bit different is the &quot;Glib Machine&quot;.  At the start, nine of the letter tiles are placed into the appropriate spots on the machine.  The handle is then pulled so that new categories are revealed in the windows above each letter.  The sand timer is turned over, and everyone quickly writes down the name of something that fits the category and begins with the given letter tile.  Once time runs out, the players score their answers.  Players score five points for every player that did not put down the same answer as they did.  So players not only have to come up with a correct answer, they need to find one unique enough not to be duplicated by the other players.  The player with the highest score after a certain number of rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",1965,,,

That is, for all who live to remember . . .<br/><br/>Candidates for the PERSON OF THE CENTURY include: (By Decade)<br/><br/>1900-1910, Emma Rhymere is probably the foremost poet and novelist of the last century. Born and raised in Boston, she's traveled the country by train, reading her book of poetry, Moors, Mores, and S'mores, to the uneducated masses across the Western frontier. Criticizing the gluttony of the rich, Emma is level-headed and lovely, and wears the high-collared, lace-adorned clothing of her time.<br/><br/>1910-1920, Mia Curall is easily considered the greatest scientist of the twentieth century. Having won Nobel prizes for both medicine and physics, her greatest claim to fame came when she discovered a cure for Bigpox. She's often described as being methodical and a little bit maniacal when it comes to her work, though socially, people say she has an electro-magnetic personality. She wears the latest of post-war clothing.<br/><br/>1920-1930, Rich A. Phellar, the owner of Substandard Oil, is easily the wealthiest man of the twentieth century. Having inherited his money from his father, Rich considers himself a true blueblood. Though he's hard-nosed and hard-handed when it comes to business, in social settings he's refined and respectable, a true gentleman. Of course, he wears only tails and a top hat for evening events.<br/><br/>1930-1940, Scarlett Harlot is probably the most gifted and gorgeous actress this century has ever known. The original fainting femme fatale, she has starred in such box office hits as: It's a Wonderful Wife, and The Lizard of Schnoz. Scarlett believes a good actress should be demure and sweet, a thing of beauty like a fine painting or sculpture. She wears only the most glamorous and glitziest of evening gowns.<br/><br/>1940-1950, General George S. Lapem is considered one of the greatest military minds the US Army has ever known. His amazing leadership abilities, along with his talent for combat strategy, played a huge role in the winning of World War II. Gruff, rough, and tough, the General was raised in a military family and comes from a long line of Generals. He only wears army fatiques or his uniform wherever he goes.<br/><br/>1950-1960, Eve N. Louder is probably the greatest fashion designer of the century. But she's also the founder of Eve N. Louder Cosmetics, one of the world's top-selling companies when it comes to make-up and perfume. Rich, spoiled and eccentric, Eve considers herself to be the original fashion police, claiming her only real goal is to make the world a more beautiful place. She always wears dresses of her own design.<br/><br/>1960-1970, Blaze A. G'laury is an all-American hero, one of the first men in space, circling the globe during a top-secret space mission, better known as the Neanderthal project. Originally from Oklahoma, Blaze is a big, brave, brawny and brainy guy, who grew up reading science fiction. Not only does he have the right stuff, but women everywhere refer to him as &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; Blaze wears jumpsuits wherever he goes.<br/><br/>1970-1980, Polly Esther Pance is probably the most influential journalist and activist this century has ever known. Founder of The Save the Sasquatch Society, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Big Foot, Polly has been involved in sit-ins and shutouts, march-downs and walkouts. She only wears the finest polyester clothes and never goes anywhere without a hefty slathering of blue eyeshadow.<br/><br/>1980-1990, Wylie &quot;Wy&quot; Toukay, is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the century, having essentially created the personal computer industry as well as the software industry that goes along with it. With an I.Q. that tops the genius range, Wy ushered the world into the Information Age and became a ga-zillionaire in the process. Wy dresses purely for comfort, never really caring about what he wears.<br/><br/>1990-1999, US President William &quot;Willy&quot; Groper is probably one of the more colorful presidents of the century. Described as having a dichotomous disposition, he's often charismatic and calculating, charming and crafty. With his award-winning smile, Willy is a real go-getter, a man whose cause has unfortunately, caused a few improprieties. Willy only wears clothes that bare a Presidential insignia.<br/><br/>This is an especially fun game if you and your guests plan to dress in costumes! Because the character roles span the entire century, everyone will be wearing fashions from a different decade. Hence you'll have Emma Rhymere in her long skirts comparing herself to Polly Esther Pance, in a pantsuit or mini-skirt. How shocking! The true gentleman, Rich A. Phellar, will be appalled by Wy Toukay's casual attire, especially at dinner!<br/><br/>To make things even more fun, the characters from the later decades will already know the history which the characters from the earlier decades are living. Plus, the characters from the earlier part of the century will be amazed by the world of the future, the world of computers and faxes and fast cars.<br/><br/>All in all, this game has a number of interesting dimensions that will keep your guests entertained for hours!<br/><br/>",1999,,,

Then watch the sparks and accusations fly, because everyone knows, the competition at a beauty pageant can really turn ugly . . .<br/><br/>The Character Roles Include:<br/><br/>Rinah Plastee is a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having recently won the title of Ms. Texas Panhandle.

She wears flashy evening fashions, accessorized by her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.<br/><br/>Harry Medusa is the President and founder of Medusa Hair Care Incorporated, as well as the corporate sponsor and founder of the Ms. Medusa Pageant. Harry is applauded by women everywhere, both for the creation of his company's products and for considering the needs of his customers. Sincere, sensible and systematic, Harry dresses in conservative clothes.<br/><br/>Wiley Wheazle is a talent agent from Southern California. A man who flashes his thousand-watt smile as easily as he flashes his credit card, Wiley brags about being able to carry on a conversation with anyone. He constantly promotes his stable of stars, and claims to work round the clock, even while he's sleeping. Personable, persistent, and persuasive, Wiley wears only retro styles.<br/><br/>Let's face it . . . we've all been under way too much stress lately . . . And this is the game to take that stress away . . . Yes, a Perfectly Perilous Pageant is just good, wacky fun.

This is done by placing their plunger in one of the vacant spaces on their side of the board and then banging it.  If their opponent has a piece in that corresponding space, it will pop up into the air.  Pieces captured in this way remain out of the game until that player moves his king up to the dividing wall, at which point he can claim a captured knight piece back (but also tips off his opponent that his king is in the front row).

4816,Xactika,['Trick-taking'],['Card Game'],"Xactika is an original card game that challenges players' ability to estimate the outcome of playing eight cards. You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly &ndash; hence the name Xactika &ndash; the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.<br/><br/>To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks. There are a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the way to make exactly the right numbers of bids is the challenge.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

The winner is the person who spells a word for all five cards.<br/><br/>Scoring is simply paying the winner a &quot;piece of eight&quot; for each uncompleted card in your hand. Each person must also pay one &quot;piece of eight&quot; per letter that his longest word is shorter than the winner's longest word.

4818,Empire,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Abstract Strategy', 'Ancient', 'Political', 'Territory Building', 'Wargame']","Empire is a strategic level, traditional hex grid and counter wargame set in a hypothetical ancient era continent.  The game is best with 4 players but can be played with 3 or 2.   Players must manage the economic, diplomatic and military affairs of their faction as they vie for control of the Empire.  Piece density is low &ndash; 117 units.  The game is low to moderate complexity by traditional wargame standards.<br/><br/>The map contains 15 (fictional) provinces of varying sizes and terrain.  There is a large ocean area.  Each Province produces Tribute (in gold coins) for the player who controls it, the amount depending upon the number and size of cities in the Province.  Tribute is spent on building units, supplying units in the field, diplomatic initiatives, building fortifications, hiring mercenaries, and bribing other players.<br/><br/>Military units are Light and Heavy Cavalry, Light and Heavy Infantry, Imperial Guards Infantry, Warships and Siege Engines.  No province can produce all of these and some can only produce 1 or 2.  Units attain Veteran status after engaging in battle, which increases their effectiveness.  Mercenaries can be hired from neutral provinces but cost more to supply than regular units.  Naval battles and amphibious operations are possible (and may be necessary, as one Province is an island).<br/><br/>Units use an innovative combination of area movement (in friendly territory) and hex-by-hex movement (elsewhere).  Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.<br/><br/>Each Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the province&rsquo;s cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an &ldquo;Influence Check&rdquo;, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.<br/><br/>The turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each &ldquo;year&rdquo; contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).<br/><br/>The map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.<br/><br/>Overall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

Opp herself.<br/><br/>Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines. Always keeping his emotions in check, he's known to be impeccably groomed and well-dressed. Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.<br/><br/>Major Hornswagle &quot;Horn&quot; D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B. Opp's USO tour group. He's an officer who takes great pride in the way he handles his entertainers, particularly his female entertainers. Flamboyant and fun-loving, he joined the armed services when he realized a uniform is like a magnet when it comes to attracting the opposite sex.<br/><br/>Jessica &quot;Jess&quot; Abell, can easily be described with one word - patriotism, with a capital P. She would do anything to help our boys fighting overseas. First there was her stint as a factory worker, a regular Rosie the Riveter, building airplanes to wipe out the Third Reich. After retiring there, she came to work as Bea B. Opp's personal secretary, traveling with the USO tour and bringing happiness to fighting men everywhere.<br/><br/>W.A.C. Pilot Bunny &quot;Bun&quot; P. Landon, is the pilot who transports Bea B. Opp's USO troupe across the ocean and throughout Europe. It's the opportunity of a lifetime for Bun. She's wanted to fly professionally since she was a little girl, when her father, the late Colonel Girrup Landon, first took her for a spin in a biplane. Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.<br/><br/>Oliver &quot;Ol&quot; W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.<br/><br/>Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as &quot;brilliant&quot; or &quot;genius.&quot; Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.<br/><br/>Winona &quot;Wi&quot; Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers. Grown up to be a glamorous songstress, she was a shoe-in when Bea B. Opp was gathering together a USO troupe. Sophisticated, sleek, and always the professional entertainer, she someday hopes to be as big a star as Miss Opp herself.<br/><br/>This is a fabulous mystery for those of you who love the 1940s and big band music. Because the storyline is centered around a USO troupe, playing swing music throughout the party is a must. Also, if you're looking for a party where everyone can dress up more glamorously, this is the game for you.<br/><br/>And since this game is set in December, if you like, you can even drag out your holiday decorations and set them up to add to the scene. This is especially fun in the middle of summer.<br/><br/>Ah, yes, was there ever a more romantic era than the 40s?<br/><br/>",1996,,,

You and his private party will take a weekend pleasure trip on that famous train, the Silver Spittoon, as it winds through the splendor of the Rocky Mountains, from Durango to Telluride. Of course, you'll be staying in one of Mr. Ritch's private Pullman cars, as well as eating in his private dining car. And on Saturday night, you'll enjoy a special celebration dinner, courtesy of Mr. Ritch's hospitality.<br/><br/>So pack your petticoats and pantaloons and hop aboard! It promises to be a weekend to remember. And for some, the opportunity of a lifetime . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Mariam Ritch is the wife of your host, R. Eli Ritch. Refined and ravishing, she runs the Ritch household so Eli can run the ranch. For she's a woman who knows her priorities and her place, and puts her husband first. Always wearing the latest of fashions from the East, she's a real society lady. Though it's rumored that her past may not be so reputable . . .<br/><br/>Bad Billy Bob Bobbitt is a rawboned rambler, known to travel from town to town, though no one seems to know what he does for a living. And while he's as good with a gun as he is at the gambling table, word has it his picture has been seen on more than one Wanted Poster. Shifty and shady, he's usually dressed to ride the range.<br/><br/>Burgandy &quot;Bur&quot; Dello, a favorite at the local watering hole, the Sure Shot Saloon, is the Belle of the Bar and star of the cancan. Having gotten her start in San Francisco, she prefers life in the wilds of Southern Colorado. She's saucy and showy, and known throughout the West for her charms that men just can't resist.<br/><br/>Chief Lost'Um Land is an elder from the little-known Sowee tribe, formerly located high in the Southern Rockies, but now living on a desert reservation in New Mexico. Diplomatic and insightful, he's greatly respected among his own people, as well as the white men's agencies. For he often says, &quot;It's never a good day to die.&quot; And of course, he always dresses in his native attire and carries his hatchet everywhere.<br/><br/>Virginia &quot;Virgin&quot; Gnomoire, is the local school marm, having relocated to the Wild West from the civilized East, where she received her formal education. She's intelligent, articulate, and patient with her students. But beneath her prim and proper exterior, as well as her conservative clothing, she's a raging beauty.<br/><br/>S. Cooper &quot;Coop&quot; DeNuze, is also from the East. Both a newspaper writer and a novelist for 7&cent; novels, he's come to the West to capture the colorful characters that have aroused the curiosity of Easterners. Outgoing and inquisitive, Coop prides himself on getting the story that sells the copy. He always dresses professionally,and since he's been out West, he sometimes wears a combination of Eastern and Western attire.<br/><br/>Manfred &quot;Man&quot; Euell Laybore, is a hard-working, honest man whose backbreaking efforts helped build the railroad that Eli now runs. Strong and ruggedly handsome, Man is known to be up front and direct in his dealings. Yet he's widely popular with the other railroad workers and known to be a leader when it comes to labor issues. His attire usually fits the occasion: whether that means working on the tracks or attending a Sunday social.<br/><br/>Aimee &quot;Aim&quot; Ann Chute, is considered the best aim in the West, and is the star of Beaver Bob's Mild West Show. Independent and headstrong, she first learned to shoot to put food on the table. Now as she travels the countryside with the Show, she lets no man run her life.

When your guests arrive at your party wearing 1880s attire, you'll see a complete transformation of their personalities. This is your chance to travel back to a colorful time in history, when the West was still wild and untamed. The setting is Durango, Colorado, where an 1880s train still takes sightseers through the splendor of the Southern Rockies.<br/><br/>",1996,,,

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>HARD DRIVE HOMICIDE -or- Who Offed the Icon?<br/><br/>Welcome to Sillycon Valley, California, and to the Boardroom of Snaphu Software, Inc., where you've been summoned by the CEO himself, Major Hugh G. Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that &quot;the sparks would be flying.&quot; Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .<br/><br/>ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:<br/><br/>Florence &quot;Flo&quot; P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.<br/><br/>Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.<br/><br/>Harvey &quot;Har&quot; D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.<br/><br/>C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in &quot;Business Casual&quot; attire.<br/><br/>Margaret &quot;Mar&quot; Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, &quot;I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do.&quot; Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.<br/><br/>Sergei &quot;Ser&quot; F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.<br/><br/>A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.<br/><br/>S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.<br/><br/>This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!<br/><br/>And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.<br/><br/>Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!<br/><br/>",1998,,,

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>LYNCHED IN LUCRE VALLEY -or- Who Rigged the Rig?<br/><br/>It's July, 1952, and the oil industry has been booming in Alberta, Canada since the end of WWII. New oil reserves have been discovered just as fast as wildcatters can set up rigs and drill. As a result, new oil and oilfield service companies have been springing up like Alberta winter wheat. One such company is Drye Holle Drilling, founded by Mr. Dryesdale &quot;Drye&quot; Holle of Lucre Valley. And tonight, you've been invited to attend the company's First Annual Safety Award Dinner, in honor of Drye Holle Drilling's remarkable safety record. And of course, the affair will be catered by the local Crude Cafe.<br/><br/>Now the real question remains: Will Drye Holle Drilling have an outstanding safety record for a second year in a row? In any case, one thing is certain, murder would definitely mar that record . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Tarra &quot;Tar&quot; Sanze is a sassy secretary who mans the front lines of Drye Holle Drilling. Known for her smarts as well as her savvy, she's a tornado on the typewriter and a dervish when it comes to dictation. Pretty as well as proficient, she's had more than her share of suitors, but the oil industry remains the love of her life. She dresses to fit the occasion - pants or skirts for trips to the field and dazzling dresses for dinner.<br/><br/>Derek Hand is the dashing Drilling Manager at Drye Holle Drilling, a company Derek has worked for since he and Drye returned from the War in Europe. Hard working and an industry expert, Derek's loyalty to the company is legendary. Because he's constantly on call, he prefers to wear casual work clothes.<br/><br/>Madame Mae Kittup is an exotic beauty from the Ukraine, a gypsy woman whose psychic powers include telling the future via her magic pysankas, or Ukrainian Easter eggs. Sultry and mysterious, Madame Mae is employed by Drye Holle Drilling to locate oil reserves far beneath the Earth's surface. Yet she attributes her great gift to her grandmother, and prefers to dress in the clothing of her native land.<br/><br/>Denver Driller is a rich and rugged oilman from the States, whose business frequently brings him to Canada, where he plans to reap the rewards of the country's bountiful resources. A world traveler, he's charming and charismatic, and a favorite among the locals. He dresses to suit the occasion, with a wardrobe that ranges from designer suits to dungarees.<br/><br/>Olivia &quot;Ol&quot; Barrinesse could be described in three simple words: rich, refined and ravishing. Originally from Calgary, she's the daughter of the late Brigham Barrinesse, from whom she inherited her wealth, as well as her independent and highly profitable oil company, Brigham Oil. Ol is always dressed in the height of fashion, famous for her foreign shopping sprees and her bounty of baubles.<br/><br/>Andre P. Renure is a bold businessman who provides a valuable service to the oilfield consumer by running Lucre Valley's only general store and restaurant, the Crude Cafe. A Frenchman from Quebec, he came to the West after the War, hoping to amass a fortune from his vocational ventures. Shrewd and sophisticated, his suits are the latest of fifties fashions.<br/><br/>Beulah &quot;Beu&quot; T. Kween is a beaming beauty from the heart of bovine country, who was raised on a cattle ranch in southern Alberta. Having won more than her share of beauty contests, everyone says her future is bright, that she'll be married with a house full of kids before she can say &quot;baby boom.&quot; Flirtatious and fun-loving, she currently works as a waitress at the Crude Cafe, where she earns enough money to keep her wardrobe stocked with delectable dresses.<br/><br/>Royal T. Ohhner is an Alberta cattle rancher whose range reaches far across some big beefy underground oil reserves - oil reserves that are leased to and drilled by Drye Holle Drilling. Thus Royal often jokes about raising both crude and cattle, which have proven to be real cash cows for him. A real grass roots kind of guy, he's never been one to steer away from hard work. He wears nothing but Western attire.<br/><br/>This mystery game features a Western Canadian setting. (If you've never seen Calgary and the Canadian Rockies, then you've never really lived!) So, of course, we used some classic characters that you might find in that neck of the bush -- the Frenchman from Quebec, the Ukranian woman and her psyankas (decorated eggs), a cattle rancher and the people in the oil industry. Of course, there's also a mention of playing hockey.<br/><br/>Besides all that, it's set in the early 1950s, which provides so much opportunity for costumes, as well as setting the mood. People can dress either 1940s or 1950s style, and you can easily play music from both decades.<br/><br/>All and all, it's a fun romp, with the same lunacy and ludicrousness as the rest of our mystery games. Watch out for the surprise twist at the end!<br/><br/>",1997,,,

Not only will you enjoy the activities of the Resort, but you'll also be driven by motor coach to the grandest marvel of all, a sightseeing tour through the rugged beauty of Yellowstone National Park. It's all the rage! Your ticket to fun and frolic awaits you: dated June 18, 1925, when flappers were risque' and prohibition was the rule. The festivities will culminate on Saturday night with a private dinner party hosted by Rum himself. (And because you'll be dining in Rum's suite, you might find the laws of prohibition to be a little . . . shall we say . . . less restrictive?) It should be a night to remember. That is, provided everyone makes it through the night . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Princess Anastasia &quot;Ann&quot; L. Retentov claims to be the only surviving descendant of that great Russian Retentov line. And because of a little-known twist of history, she is the last remaining heir to the Russian throne, daughter of Czar Frugalin Retentov I and Czarina Wautor Retentov. Having fled the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Ann came to America for sanctuary. As a princess, she carries herself regally, being a classic Russian beauty and dressing in the finest of fashions.<br/><br/>Dewey Kare, is a baseball legend who has redefined the game, being both a pitching phenom and a home run hitter. But being worshiped as a hero got tiresome for Dewey. So he recently retired, and has traveled to the wilds of Montana in search of a new adventure. Yet he never forgets his years in the big leagues, and always wears a baseball jersey.<br/><br/>Cassandra &quot;Cass&quot; Piajammas is a lovely &amp; luscious starlet, having recently starred in her latest film, The Monotony of Marlene. And soon she is to grace the silver screen as Valentino's leading lady. Which is no surprise, considering acting is a talent that comes quite naturally to Cass. After all, her mother always did say Cass was a little melodramatic. But she's also a thoroughly modern woman of the twenties, a real flapper. And like most flappers, she's opinionated, daring and slightly out-of-control.<br/><br/>Barry &quot;Bare&quot; Marquette is a Wall Street whiz known for his gutsy gambles and daring dealings. He loves the excitement of the market, with all the ups and downs, and the dangers as well as the chance to get rich quick. Born and raised in Chicago, he tried a number of jobs at home before finally going to New York to be near the market. And because he's much sought after by women, he dresses in the height of style, sparing no expense to look dashing and dapper.<br/><br/>Isadore &quot;Izzy&quot; A. G. Mann has often been described as a chameleon-like character, easily able to change and adapt to any situation, at any time. Thus he always dresses to fit the occasion. And because he's come to Montana on vacation and wants to relax, he doesn't care to talk about his work much - though he will admit to being employed by the government. Focused and determined, he's a hard worker, and never quits until he gets the job done right.<br/><br/>Stephanie &quot;Steph&quot; D. Rink is a prim and pretty prohibitionist, probably one of the most popular in the country. For her name is synonymous with sober. Often called Sister Steph, she's the founder of the Church of the Triple R - the Real Right Reformed. As a staunch activist and a prolific preacher, she's known to be quite vocal. And because she's always in the public eye, she's particular about her appearance, and often quick to follow the latest fashion fads.<br/><br/>Senator Vito D. Beale is a United States Senator from Illinois. A man of great power and passion, politics is in his blood, as he comes from a well-established and wealthy political family. Vito chooses his issues carefully and then fights for them to the finish. Yet he's also quite charming and cordial to the voters, and because he's got an important public image to uphold, he always dresses to the nines.<br/><br/>Mary Widdoe, is a strikingly beautiful and well-to-do young widow who just recently lost her husband. Now, wherever she goes, she carries the urn that holds the ashes of her late husband Ernie, for as she says: &quot;He made me everything I am.&quot; Her friends describe her as being wonderfully charming and a great listener. And as a grieving widow, Mary often wears black, though usually in the form of designer dresses.<br/><br/>This mystery game is especially fun for history buffs. Not only is the main storyline centered around Prohibition, but many of the characters are based (loosely) on actual historic figures. Izzy A. G. Mann, is a spoof on Izzy Einstein, one of the most famous Prohibition Agents of all. Of course, Princess Ann L. Retentov, is based somewhat on Annastasia Romanov.<br/><br/>This game also has some special features that others don't have. For instance, a few of the clues are to be hidden around the room, and this game includes an &quot;X&quot; that marks the spot, though I won't tell you where.<br/><br/>Costumes from the twenties are especially fun, as that was the era of flappers and men in wide-lapeled pinstriped suits. Also popular at the time was a train ride from Chicago to Montana, to enjoy the splendor of Yellowstone.<br/><br/>If you like history, you'll love this mystery!<br/><br/>",1996,,,

The Andrews Sisters and Glenn Miller are be-bopping over the wireless, and women's hemlines are just a little bit higher than they were a few years ago. Sugar and gasoline and nearly everything else is being rationed while World War II is raging in Europe and the Pacific.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, you're at home in Phunguss Flats, Florida, a town that supports the War effort and our soldiers fighting overseas. Of course, the war hasn't hindered the activities of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. As a member, you're about to attend the monthly luncheon meeting scheduled for today. As always, it's being held in the clubhouse, just up the walk and past the Sycamore trees from the club's greenhouse. This month's special speaker will be Dr. H. Orty Kulchure, local professor of Botany, who also served as the judge for last month's rose competition. Dr. Kulchure will be speaking on the subject of &quot;Practical Pruning, or Using Those Dead Limbs for Fertilizer.&quot;<br/><br/>With the motto, &quot;Our Petals are Perpetually Open,&quot; you might say the Phunguss Flats Garden Club has a long and lascivious history, one that's fueled a lot of talk around the town.<br/><br/>For all who live to talk about it, that is . . .<br/><br/>Members of the Phunguss Flats, Florida Garden Club Are:<br/><br/>Mumsy Worde is the President of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club.

Both pretty and openly opinionated, she is married to the Mayor, the wealthiest man in Phunguss Flats. Yet despite her privilege, Barb prides herself on having perfected the art of self-sacrifice. She prefers to wear dresses with large flowered-prints and hats to match.<br/><br/>Schyla &quot;Schye&quot; Sphinstere is the Garden Club's Treasurer, as well as the town's librarian. Sweet, shy and somewhat secretive, she's an avid reader of romance novels and is still waiting for a prince on a Palomino to whisk her away. And while she's waiting for our military men to return stateside, Schye is active in the War effort, keeping the home fires hot. She wears mostly skirts and sweaters.<br/><br/>Auntie Pausto is as famous for her pasta as she is for her petunias. A first generation Italian-American, Auntie Pausto is proud of her heritage. And though she works part-time as a cook at the Phunguss Cafe, her family remains her number one priority. Lovely and lively, she prefers lace to linen, and owns an apron for every occasion.<br/><br/>Daisy Flinger is the illustrious and affluent heiress to the great Flinger Darning Machine fortune. Never married, she lives in her mansion with a multitude of cats and claims: &quot;You can never be too rich or have too many tabbies.&quot; While she wears the latest of 40s fashions, she believes she is never fully dressed until she is adorned with diamonds.<br/><br/>Sharla &quot;Shar&quot; P. Knedelz is an Army nurse who is home from the frontlines, having recently returned from the trenches of war-torn Europe.

Hailed by Hollywood Today magazine as &quot;the brightest star bound to burn out before her time,&quot; she is one of the most sought-after celebrities in America. Because of her fame, she absolutely, positively, in-no-way and under-no-conditions goes anywhere without wearing her makeup, as well as the most up-to-date, eye-catching attire.<br/><br/>Sister Celeste &quot;Cel&quot; I. Bett is new to the local nunnery, run by the Sisters of Incessant Anguish. Having recently relocated from New York, Sister Cel is thoughtful and intelligent, and enjoys a wide range of interests, from science to foreign languages. Though she's an outspoken activist for peace, she rallies behind the efforts of the Allied Forces. Of course, she wears nothing but her nun's habit.<br/><br/>All right, ladies . . . do you have a bridal shower or a baby shower coming up sometime soon? Or maybe a favorite friend is about to have a birthday, or maybe you're just looking for an excuse to get together with your female friends? Then here's your chance to add tons of hilarity to your gathering.<br/><br/>Part of the irony of the game is that all the characters initially appear so prim and proper, in their hats and gloves, as they attend the Garden Club meeting. It isn't long before you learn that these ladies are anything but prim and proper! Kind of like real life, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>Costuming is very easy -- hats and gloves and dresses or suits. In other words, everyone can pretty much just go to their closets. If you like, you can play this game as a part of a luncheon, or play it in the evening with drinks and snacks.

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner. Designed for a women-only setting.<br/><br/>High Tea at the Liberty Library -or- Who Toasted the Tart?<br/><br/>Ladies . . . It's May, 1955 and time once again for the monthly meeting of the Liberty Library League. This meeting promises to be one you won't want to miss, with plenty of topics to talk about. First of all, Nona Tumuch, the famous author who recently released that scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed, has finally decided to step off that high-and-mighty horse she's been riding and join the Liberty Library League. Though one must wonder, what made her finally accept an invitation and be part of a group she has spurned for so long?<br/><br/>Of course, there will also be the final dollar count from last week's Library League Bake Sale. Hopefully, with the sales of the goodies from Cooky Kuttre and Meena Ann Moody, the Library League might finally be able to afford that statue of the famous Outlaw Jose Whines, who once called Liberty his home. Oh, and speaking of Meena Ann Moody, she's let everyone know that she'll be making a big announcement at the meeting, one she claims will impact everyone's lives. Hopefully she won't be pulling any dusty skeletons from any musty closets, as no doubt, everyone's got a few secrets they'd rather remained that way . . . SECRET! In any case, as usual, the Liberty Library Leagues meets during High Tea at the Liberty Library . . . Though this may be one High Tea that sinks to a much lower level . . .<br/><br/>Also Attending the Liberty Library League Meeting Will Be:<br/><br/>Priscilla &quot;Priss&quot; E. Dings is the President of the Liberty Library League, having been elected to the position for seven years in a row. The wife of prominent attorney, Wynn G.

Priss dresses in the latest of fifties fashions, and never goes anywhere without a hat and matching gloves.<br/><br/>Nona Tumuch is one of the nation's top novelists. Her name has practically become a household word ever since she released her scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed. Some say the book reflects the seamier side of Liberty, a side that many of the town's prominent citizens would rather keep under wraps. As an author, Nona is intelligent, outspoken, and always investigating the latest story. She wears suits of subtle colors, with a hat and gloves to match.<br/><br/>Hope Leslie Devoted is the Fan Club President for that most sensational of all singers, America's #1 heartthrob himself, Bobby Daring. What an honor for any woman! Hope takes her presidential duties seriously, and is instantly offended if someone speaks badly about Bobby. Dreamy, dramatic and determined, Hope spends a lot of time at the library, reading all the latest &quot;Bobby Babble&quot; in the magazines. She wears skirts and sweaters, and usually ties a scarf around her neck.<br/><br/>Garnett Jeuell was once elected Debutante of the Year at Liberty's annual Country Club Cotillion, an honor that landed her more marriage proposals than she could count. Now engaged to a handsome local businessman, Har D. Wirkenslob, Garnett spends most of her time planning the perfect wedding and shopping for the most fabulous home furnishings she can find. Sassy, showy, and sharp-witted, Garnett prefers flashy frocks and jeweled accessories.<br/><br/>Cooky Kuttre is an acutely happy homemaker, a woman who finds total fulfillment from merely meeting the needs of her man, her husband, Mete Kuttre. Like all really good housewives, Cooky is the queen of the kitchen, and just loves to spend her time concocting the latest culinary creation. She also brags about having a house where &quot;dirt dare not tread, for fear it will instantly be sucked into the vacuum bag.&quot; Active, opinionated, and organized, Cooky wears simple dresses and never goes anywhere without her apron.<br/><br/>Madame Fabra Cates is a clairvoyant who recently relocated to Liberty, after her spirit guides strongly suggested she move here. Fabra not only tells the future by reading tea leaves, but she also claims to communicate with those who have passed from this life to the next. Temperamental, thoughtful, and theatrical, Fabra prefers to wear wildly colored clothing, with lots of jewelry and a bright headscarf.<br/><br/>Gussie D. Uppe has recently returned home to Liberty, after mysteriously being away for six months. A trust-fund tot, her father owns the biggest bank in Liberty, and Gussie grew up with an abundance of riches. She is often considered the best bridge player in town, though she is also quite adept at Canasta and Charades, and many other party games. Tight-lipped, tenacious, and trustworthy, Gussie wears the latest of designer clothes, hats and gloves.<br/><br/>Luv Swept is a writer of romance novels and has recently moved to Liberty to research the tragic life and death of her long, lost twin brother, Adonis Studd. Luv hopes to write his story into one of her novels, much like her own numerous ill-fated love affairs have been the inspiration for her books thus far.

Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).<br/><br/>A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom &quot;wacky die&quot; shows sword or shield icons.<br/><br/>The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.<br/><br/>The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.<br/><br/>Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).<br/><br/>",1994,,,

The Invasion of Canada follows the fortunes of Arnold and Montgomery, as they attempt to add a 14th Colony to those in rebellion. Saratoga 1777 covers the British attempt to conquer the Hudson Valley. Summer 1780 features the British attempt to separate the colonies of the Deep South from their rebellious brethren to the North, and finally Greene's Carolina Campaign follows the attempt by Nathaniel Greene to rectify the previous year's failure by Horatio Gates.<br/><br/>THE RULES cover Militia, promotions, supply, leader exchanges', entrenchements, initiative, attrition, politics, Indians, and even Lord Germain. The naval rules cover amphibious assaults, interception at sea, ocean transport, and blockade. Counters represent regiments, naval squadrons, leaders, artillery, Indians, the French, etc. <br/>Each turn represents 2 weeks, or a month (in winter), with strategic interphases between turns. Victory is determined by the relative standing of the two sides on a Political Track, which is in turn, determined by a variety of events and by control of the vatious colonies. <br/>The British player generally moves first in each game turn, but the American, player may, by the accumulation of Victory Points, acquire and use (at the moment of his choosing) Initiative Chits, which enable him to reverse the order of movement-s-thus seizing the initiative.<br/><br/>Designed by award-winning designer Rob Markham, Give Me Liberty! is both an accurate and detailed simulation, and also a fast paced and intense game.<br/><br/>CONTENTS: <br/><br/>    One rulebook <br/>    Two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps<br/>    400 die&middot;cut counters<br/>    One 10&middot;sided<br/><br/><br/>PLAYERS: 2&middot;4,also makes an excellent solitaire game.<br/><br/>PLAYING TIME: 2-6 hours, depending upon scenario chosen.<br/><br/>",1992,,,

One commands the northern forces, the other commands the southern forces.  It is up to you as one of the commanders to develop the strategy and make the decisions which will give you the best chance to win.  The course of the war is in your hands.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the year 1863, the Confederate and Union armies were closely balanced.  Either side could still win.  There were differences - the North had more troops while the South had better ones with more mobility.  But the decisive battles lay in the future.  Final victory would be determined by the same factors for the Union and the Confederacy alike: sufficient fighting strength in the right place at the right time, daring and clever tactics, and luck.  The players of this game must fight the same even fight.  The same skill, daring and luck are required of you, if you want to win.&quot; - Taken from games rules introduction.<br/><br/>User review: There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry, and gunboats. Infantry can move one space on land each turn. Cavalry can move up to two spaces on land each turn. Gunboats may move up to two spaces each turn and may transport infantry. Units may move orthogonally and diagonally.<br/><br/>The gameboard is an 18 x 18 grid of squares. Starting places for the units, railroads, key cities, mountains, and important waterways are denoted.<br/><br/>Players alternate taking turns with the Confederate player moving first. Combat occurs when opposing forces occupy the same space. The rules are more detailed but a larger force always defeats the smaller force. A player forces the opponent to remove units from play by capturing any of the opponent&rsquo;s key cities.<br/><br/>The player who eliminates all of the opponent&rsquo;s units or gets the opponent to surrender is the winner.<br/><br/>[27 December 2012] This game was first published in Life Magazine, volume 50 number 11, 17 March 1961.

If you accomplish your goals, you score points.<br/><br/>The board is made up of five straight lanes, each a sequence of rectangular areas, and each rectangular subdivision has four dots of the racer's path (ie, ten consecutive rectangles will require dice-rolls totaling 40 to advance through).  Players also have a hand of four cards which conveniently overlay these rectangles and which have differing numbers of dots (from 0 to 8).  On a player's turn, he or she may play one of these overlaying cards on the board so as to make any player's path longer or shorter.  Then the player rolls the dice and moves his racer.<br/><br/>In the &quot;advanced&quot; game, each player also has a hand of four action cards, some of which can be played on others and some of which can only be played on oneself.

Sir Roger, as you may know, is the principal shareholder of the giant conglomerate Watersdown Beverages Ltd., and known far and wide as a jovial host.

After both players have spun, the one with the most &quot;M's&quot; wins the Combat and gets to knock over 1 or 2 of the opposing creatures.<br/>4. Once knocked over, the defeated creatures are out of the game. Players leave defeated creatures lying on the arena, but those creatures are not counted as occupying space, and may be moved around as necessary to make room for more Combat.<br/>5. If both players spin the same number of &quot;M's,&quot; the battle is a tie and will continue after the player takes his/her turn moving.<br/>6. Once each player has had one chance to do battle on every space where his/her creatures are in Combat, it becomes the next player's turn to move. This player takes his/her turn moving even if there was a tie in the battle or if both players still have creatures standing on the same space after the battle.<br/>7. Play continues for the rest of the game with one player taking a turn moving, then a Combat round (if there are any Combat situations on the board), then the other player takes his/her turn moving, and so on.<br/>8.

By the end of the century, the American &ldquo;Yellow Press&rdquo; had made attempts by Cuban revolutionaries to overthrow Spanish colonial rule a leading news story. American public opinion demanded that Spain grant independence to Cuba.<br/><br/>When the U.S. battleship Maine mysteriously exploded in Havana harbor, President McKinley could no longer resist the tide of public sentiment. The U.S. government demanded that Spain withdraw from Cuba, and the U.S. Navy initiated a blockade of Cuban ports on 21 April 1898.<br/><br/>For the sake of honor, Spain declared war on 23 April and dispatched an ill-equipped and completely outclassed fleet to the Caribbean. In two smashing naval victories the U.S. Navy defeated the Spanish fleets in the Philippines and the Caribbean. The U.S. Army seized Santiago de Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Manila.<br/><br/>The fighting ended in less than four months, but the diplomats needed eight more to reach a peace agreement. The Spanish Cortes, unable to accept either its loss of Great Power status or that of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines, rejected the treaty. The Queen Regent overruled their action to prevent further consequences. The &ldquo;Disaster of &rsquo;98&rdquo; crushed Spanish national pride and helped undermine Spanish democracy and constitutionalism.<br/><br/>For quite different reasons the U.S. people and government were divided over the treaty. They questioned annexing Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Many did not want to give up their isolationism. The war served notice that the U.S. was now a Great Power. The twentieth century would become one of American world influence.<br/><br/>1898: The Spanish American War includes 22 scenarios. Of these, 15 are playable with the game pieces and maps provided in the game. The other seven require one or more pieces from other Great War at Sea titles. Two campaign scenarios allow players to play out the entire war at sea.<br/><br/>The operational map covers the area around Cuba and Puerto Rico where the war&rsquo;s most important campaign took place.

4961,Sunda to Sahul,['Tile Placement'],"['Exploration', 'Prehistoric', 'Puzzle', 'Real-time', 'Territory Building']","This is a lightweight strategy game for 2 to 4 people which also includes a number of challenging puzzles for 1 player. The theme of the game is the migration of people down the Indonesian archipelago into New Guinea and Australia. The games is based on a set of 136 laser cut wooden jigsaw like tiles which go together in a multitude of ways to form a set of islands.<br/><br/>The game starts with all of the tiles face up on the playing surface and one tile in a cleared space in the center of the playing surface to start play. Players select a tile from the pool of upturned tiles and try to join tiles to it to extend the islands of an archipelago, 'discovering' a different set of islands each time they play the game. Each player has a number of tokens for his clan or totem. The aim of the game is to claim nodes (points on the land of the islands where the corners of a number of tiles come together). The player who places the last tile at a node may claim that node for his clan. If an island is completed then all of the tokens on the island double in value. There is therefore an incentive for players who have tokens on an island to cooperate to complete the island, but of course each is trying to get more out of the cooperation than the others. The game ends when one player has used all of his tokens or when no further tiles can be placed, or when the players agree to finish.<br/><br/>The game can be played either as a race game with all players working simultaneously or as a turns based game. The race game takes about 30-45 minutes to play, while the turns based games takes 60-90 minutes to play. There are a number of optional game elements that can be added once players are comfortable with the basic game: fresh water rights (for water surrounded by land), tribes (clan tokens in a tribe are worth more than on their own), challenges (where a player can try to convert a token to their clan), and resources (owned by the player with the most tokens on the island at the end of the game). Some of these game elements result in a more cooperative styled game while some result in more conflict. Players can mix and match the game elements to produce a style of game that suits their mood or style of play.<br/><br/>The publisher's website <a target='_blank' href=""http://sagacity.aires.com.au"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer noopener"">http://sagacity.aires.com.au</a> formerly had more information but appears to be defunct as of mid-2010.<br/><br/>",2002,,,
4962,1914,"['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']","['Wargame', 'World War I']","1914 is a traditional hex and counter wargame that attempts to simulate the opening phases of WW I on the Western Front.  This was James Dunnigan&rsquo;s second game for Avalon Hill. Like many wargames combat is resolved through the use of dice and a Combat results table (CRT).<br/><br/>The players accumulate victory points by occupying 24 key areas at the game end as well as points for enemy units destroyed.  The Eastern Front with Russia is abstracted and the German player may receive victory points for deploying part of his initial forces there, and will lose points for invading Belgium, Luxembourg or Holland.  The player who most effectively wears down his opponent and holds geographical objectives will win the game.<br/><br/>This game is particularly complex in comparison to other Avalon Hill games at the time.  Not only does it have a 34 page rulebook, use unit facing, supply line limitations, and a CRT,  there are also multiple options for fog of war (counters turned upside down or dummy counters), and step losses for units.   There is a short and long version of the game as well as cards for several variants.  Several options such as simultaneous movement and delayed commands require a third player as a referee.  The long version of the game may take multiple sittings to accomplish.<br/><br/>While not an easy 'game' to play, 1914 is a rewarding simulation both innovative for its day and enjoyable to play. While this game is very different from other games from the period and has a couple of faintly tedious mechanics it is worth the effort and can be quite exciting to play. By today's standards we would like to see forced march and some command hurtles for the over extended Germans but one could say something similar about most old games.  This game does not allow players to ramp up a decided combat advantage from a god's eye point of view. No individual combat is decisive and one can only manage this not overcome it. The game needs to be played with all its bells and whistles (minus those requiring a referee) and when one bothers to do this they find an intriguing game of deception where planning pays off.<br/><br/>For those who do not have the revision kit:<br/><br/>Forced March:<br/>Each unit rolls on a D6 (as I recall this is limited to infantry and cavalry units)<br/>1,2 Cannot move at all.<br/>3-6 Gain 1 mp.<br/><br/>The Plan 17 rule requires the French to make 6 attacks on turns 1-3.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1. 390 Die Cut Counters in two sheet (note: 37 of the 390 are blank counters.)<br/>2.

The battle marked the first and only encounter of history's two most renowned generals, Sir Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.  A brutal day-long French assault against the British held ridge brought Wellington's army to the brink of defeat.  By later afternoon, however, the arrival of Wellington's allies tipped the odds decisively against the French; Napoleon chose to stake his empire on the outcome of a final attack by his most trusted troops &ndash; the Imperial Guard.  Wellington's Victory is played on an innovative game map composed of four 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map sections on which significant differences in ground contours are differentiated by color.  There are five distinct contour levels depicted on the map as well as an extremely accurate survey of all battle field terrain features including Hougomont, La Haye Sainte, and almost every other farm and dwelling, woods and orchards, streams and ponds, and raised and sunken roads.<br/><br/>Each of more than 500 French, Prussian and Anglo-Dutch combat and command units are fully identified by battalion, regiment, brigade, division and corps designations as well as numerical game values which differentiate each unit's strength, effectiveness, and mobility.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a fifteen minute Game-Turn.  Each mapsheet hex represents a distance of 100 yards.  Each Strength Point represents 100 infantry or cavalry troops or one gun or howitzer within an artillery battery.  Each Game-Turn employs a unique, asymmetrical, sequence of play in which Players alternately participate in a series of Phases covering activities which include the execution of chain of command mechanics (such as activating and committing reserve formations and initiating cavalry charges), rallying disordered and routed units, executing facing and formation changes (including a repertoire of infantry formations such as column, line, square and open order or skirmish formation), regular and grand tactical movement, and finally executing artillery and small arms fire as well as infantry and cavalry shock command.<br/><br/>The Fire and Shock Combat mechanics which decide the battle were also designed to yield realistic results without sacrificing playability.  Fire resolution requires no arithmetic calculation since each unit fires separately.  The Relative Firepower Table used to resolve Fire Combat is a new type of CRT which directly interrelates the strength, formation and quality of the firing unit with the formation and terrain cover employed by the defending unit.  The Shock Combat Table is also unique in that it employs an &ldquo;odds&rdquo; comparison to account for Troop strength differences between the attacker and defender and a &ldquo;differential&rdquo; comparison to account for any qualitative difference between the opposing forces.  Losses, which are recorded directly on the map by placing a Strength marker under the unit suffering casualties, may result from either Fire or Shock combat.  In general, however, Shock Combat is depicted as a &ldquo;morale showdown&rdquo; more useful for gaining ground than inflicting casualties.<br/><br/>Morale, which Napoleon deemed to be three times as important as numerical strength on the battlefield, is accurately accounted for in the Effectiveness Rating assigned to every infantry battalion, cavalry regiment and artillery battery crew.<br/><br/>Buyer's Guide for WELLINGTON'S VICTORY<br/>The following ratings are based on at least 100 player-replies to surveys conducted through Strategy &amp; Tactics Magazine.

Noteworthy is the unusual board, which features hurdles whose bars can be moved up and down to any of four numbered positions.  When you clear a hurdle, you reset its bar to the position corresponding to the die's *bottom* facing (i.e., the face opposite that which you just rolled). &quot;What happens when it's a 5 or 6&quot;, you say. Cleverly, this is never an issue because the &quot;5&quot; has been replaced by a horseshoe symbol (with special rules) and the &quot;6&quot; is of course opposite &quot;1&quot;, and 1 is never sufficient to clear a hurdle.<br/><br/>",1989,,,
4977,VOR: Der Mahlstrom,"['Action Points', 'Secret Unit Deployment']","['Adventure', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']","VOR is a science-fiction miniatures game that takes place inside a mysterious galaxy-sized anomaly (VOR) of unknown origin.  The anomaly randomly sucks worlds (and their inhabitants) through time-space and once in the VOR, all worlds drift toward the center (the Maelstrom) and their doom.  The inhabitants of the worlds pulled into the Vor are locked in a struggle with each other for survival.  Players fight as one of many races trapped in the VOR.<br/><br/>VOR is a squad-based wargame from FASA (beloved publisher of material for the well-known Battletech, Traveller, Fading Suns, and EarthDawn games).  It has an extraordinarily innovative ruleset from which other games have since borrowed and with perhaps one of the best movement systems of any of the squad miniature games.  The system supports a unit popping around a corner (out of cover), shooting, and moving back efficiently.  This game uses a hit and wound determination model much like GW's Warhammer 40K.  The rules allow you to put together your own units and characters to represent new civilizations drawn into the Vor.  Yes, you can use all those miniatures from all those other games you own!!<br/><br/>There are some interesting miniatures (such as the Growler race) included with the base game and you can purchase additional units (even some unreleased) from Iron Wind Metals and Ral Partha, but the game is now fan-supported as the original publisher is no longer actively releasing new supplements.<br/><br/>",1999,,,
4978,Warzone (Second Edition),"['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Variable Phase Order']","['Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']","Warzone (second edition) was an effort to even out some of the excesses from Warzone 1st edition but keep the squad-based flexible feel of Warzone (as compared to, say, Warhammer 40k).<br/><br/>It used the standard setup, army lists, actions for units, and stats like most of the Sci-Fi wargames of the time.  The real departures were a one-shot, one-armor save mechanics (unlike roll to hit, wound, armor save, save as in 40k) and flexible movement that had the two players alternate between armies rather than move all of one army at a time.<br/><br/>This edition was distinguished by particularly purple prose in the world view section, excellent art accumulated from the Mutant Chronicles universe so far, and a generic feel to the squads and characters.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Warzone<br/><br/><br/>",1998,,,
4979,Blood Berets,"['Action Points', 'Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame']","Blood Berets was Target Games first entry into the American gaming market. It preceded the later, more popular boardgames (Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen) and the English release of the roleplaying game on which it was based. Blood Berets is only slightly more complex than Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen because it is really not much more than a streamlined version of the roleplaying game's combat system.<br/><br/>This game included many of the rules of popular wargames, including a chit-based initiative system, cover, hidden deployment, and model facing.  It too used Target Games's one hit, one armor roll system (with a d20) for fast action.  This game was distinguished by a card for each character.  When the character was hit once (or twice, for the Nepharites), the card was turned over, revealing an injured portrait and lower stats for the injured character.  When the character was hurt twice (or four times, for the Nepharites), it died. The game is enjoyable, but since it has only three mission scenarios, it does not lend itself to much variation upon repeat plays.  The human player is aware of the general location of mutants through the use of his &quot;scanner&quot; - which is counters placed on various tiles (revealed when a tile is overturned and replaced with the appropriate miniature).  Even so, the game is an enjoyable introduction to the roleplaying game and is very adaptable for those gamers who like to tinker with rules systems to develop their own variants. The subsequent development of Warzone as a tabletop miniatures wargame added a large number of metal miniatures that could be used in variants of the game.<br/><br/>Probably the most innovative part of the game (for its time) was the inclusion of 18 plastic miniatures for playing the game, each in its own foam compartment neatly stored in the bottom of the box. Six Blood Berets were included (1 Sgt., 1 Medic, and 4 Grunts), 10 Undead Legionnaires, and 2 Nepharites (bad guy leaders). Heartbreaker produced a limited line of miniatures suitable for use with Blood Berets shortly after the game was released. These miniatures were lead and featured the Bauhaus Rangers with the Deathlockdrum machine gunner and Sgt. with 4 Grunts. There were also lead minis of Nepharites and Undead Legionnaires.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 39 &amp; 40 that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Blood Berets. New scenarios, rules, items and pretorian stalkers.<br/><br/>",1993,,,

So it is in every round of Cityscape.<br/><br/>Before beginning a city, the players set secret goals for their view of the buildings in the completed city.  Each line of sight gets a separate goal, such as the number of buildings that will be visible, or how many are equal in height.

This is not a complete game; players are required to independantly purchase miniatures and construct a playing surface (wargames terrain). The game is scaled for 10mm miniatures (1:144, N Scale), and is designed to represent combat at the regiment and brigade level set in a fantasy/renaissance techology world.<br/><br/>In Warmaster, combat and casualty calculations occur at the stand level. That is, for every stand in a unit, a number of dice are rolled in combat. As whole stands are removed by sustaining casualties, the number of dice similalry decreases.<br/><br/>The command mechanism in Warmaster is simple but evocative. Each leader model has a Command factor. To issue a command, such as 'move forward' to a unit, two dice must be rolled against that target command factor. For every subsequent order attempted the target number becomes more difficult to achieve. As a consequence, despite being on the surface a move-counter move system, the turns are variable length and each player may not have the full opportunity to achieve everything they may want to. This simple mechanism introduces enjoyable tension into what is otherwise a largely conventional set of wargame rules.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Warmaster Annual 2002<br/>    Warmaster Annual 2003<br/>    Warmaster Armies<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Warmaster Ancients<br/>    The Battle of Five Armies<br/><br/><br/>Supported by the Warmaster magazine.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

No dice or other elements of chance.<br/><br/>One player (a referee) plots and writes the basics of a crime set in Victorian London. The other players (detectives) have little to work with at the start other than a description of what occurred, plus some information on the main characters. From that point on, it becomes a race against the clock since each crime must be solved within a set number of turns known only to the referee.<br/><br/>The mechanics are simple: detectives submit questions in writing to the referee. After collecting all of them, the referee answers them verbally. This means that the answers usually are understood only by the asking players. Questions must be very specific: for example, a player can check bank records only if he or she has spent part of a turn going to the bank. A mixed group of players will always have one or two ahead of the pack and one or two behind. Players also may pool information, but some always will hold back.<br/><br/>Elementary Watson is simple to play, difficult to master because it requires role-playing thinking. Players can choose areas of expertise, which might help them gain additional clues. A game board of London with neighborhoods and landmarks is included, but Elementary Watson can be played with paper and pencil.<br/><br/>",1978,,,
