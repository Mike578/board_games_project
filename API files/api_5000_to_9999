5000,Tuf-abet,[],['Word Game'],"Players compete against time and one another to be the first to use all (or most) of their 20 letter-cubes.  Each player has the same combination of cubes, but the letters are randomized by rolling prior to each turn.  The 3-minute timer is then started.<br/><br/>The first player to complete their grid (to their satisfaction) calls &quot;Tuf&quot; and receives an 8 point bonus at which time a second timer is started (2 minutes).  If anyone else should top that player's number of used letters (must beat, not match), they may call &quot;Tuffer&quot; and start the 1-minute timer.  At this time, the &quot;Tuf&quot; player may re-enter the competition by reorganizing his cubes (but the &quot;Tuffer&quot; player is hands-off).  Should someone top the &quot;Tuffer&quot; player's tally during this one-minute span, he or she shouts &quot;Tuffest&quot; and the turn is over.  Otherwise, players simply finish their grids before the minute is over and then everyone totals their score.<br/><br/>Bonus points are given for capitalized words, longer words (6+ letters), and intersecting letters in the grid.  Also, the Tuf and Tuffest players receive 8 point bonuses (this often being the same player who uses all 20 cubes during the first 3-minute segment).<br/><br/>",1969,,,

5002,Pro Golf,['Dice Rolling'],"['Dice', 'Sports']","This is a statistical simulation of PGA golf.<br/><br/>Each player has a &quot;Player Card&quot; that models the performance of a PGA golfer and the table uses a &quot;Course Booklet&quot; which models a famous course--the first two were Augusta National and the Pebble Beach Golf Links.<br/><br/>Each shot, the player rolls 2 dice and reads them low number/high number and checks his player card to determine the result of the shot  LL=Long Left, SR=Short Right, etc.  This result is checked in the course booklet to determine where the ball landed and the &quot;club&quot;  (i.e. the column on his player card:  FW, LI, MI, SI, CH, PITCH, SD) that will be used for his next shot and any penalty for being in the rough/trees/sand/etc.  Occasionally, an option will be given to the player to layup or &quot;Go for the Green!&quot;  using a longer club.<br/><br/>If a number comes up, the player is on the green and the number determines the distance left on his putt.  For putting, if the number rolled on the putting column is greater than or equal to the distance left to the pin, the putt is good.  Otherwise, unless the putt is badly missed (which checks another &quot;Second Putt Card&quot; to determine the length of the next putt), the second putt is assumed to always good.<br/><br/>Record the score for the hole.  Repeat 17 more times for entire round.<br/><br/>",1981,,,

One player (the sorcerer player) hides the wand in his realm and defends it with a group of evil sorcerers who can summon the aid of demons, orcs, and ghouls. The other player (the wizard player) invades with a force of good wizards, barbarians, dwarves, and elves, seeking to locate the wand and escape with it.<br/><br/>Before the play of the game begins, both players secretly design their forces. The board portrays the valley of the evil sorcerers, and on it the sorcerer player places the counters representing haunts (temples, ruins, and crypts), secretly recording one of them as the haunt in which the wand is hidden. The counters representing the sorcerers and their minions are then placed on the board, and on the sorcerer player's first turn they can begin summoning other evil units. The wizard player brings in the wizard units and their allies through one or more hexes along the valley border, and the struggle begins.<br/><br/>Each side can attack with spells and by physical combat. The wizard player should usually try to strike quickly, before the sorcerer player can organize an effective resistance. Only the sorcerer player gets a steady stream of reinforcements, in the form of wandering-orc counters, but the wizard player has the advantage of special attacking bonuses. To win, the wizard player must locate the wand and remove it from the sorcerers' valley through an entry/exit hex.<br/><br/>",1983,,,

Joined by the Druids of the Welsh isle of Mona, the British rebels defeated the Roman Ninth Legion and razed Britain's two largest cities, Londinium and Camulodunum. <br/>But the Roman governor, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, marshalled two legions and processed to destroy a Briton force ten times its size, destroying the revolt.  Boudicca disappeared from history, probably taking poison.  As for Paulinus, his repression in the aftermath was so severe that Tacitus, in his famed phrase, described it as &quot;making a desert and calling it peace.&quot;<br/><br/>Druid is a vivid simulation of Boudicca's Rebellion, a fast-paced board wargame of Ancient &quot;guerilla warfare.&quot;  Barbarian and Roman players battle across first-century Britain, burning villages and sacking towns.  The undisciplined Britons are initially strong, but must rally the disparate tribes of the island in revolt against the well-trained legions of Imperial Rome.  The Roman forces begin as weak, but can call on powerful reinforcements.  The Britons must hit cities and melt into the vast forests of the island where they cannot be found by Rome's legionaries. A wealth of &quot;chrome&quot; rules make the game interesting and provide repeated play value; rules are provided for tribal revolts, hidden deployment, legion activation, Druid invocation, and berserk units.  <br/>An unusual wargame on an unusual topic, Druid proves the claim that some of history's least known conflicts can make some of its best games.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Boudicca: The Warrior Queen<br/><br/><br/>",1984,,,

Start by placing your plastic Gingerbread Man (or other character marker) at the beginning of the track.  Each turn, players draw a simple card and move by matching the color on the card to the next color on the track.  Some cards show a named location on the board; players who draw these cards move forward or backward on the track to the named location.  The game ends when the first player arrives at Candy Castle by reaching or moving beyond the last square on the track.<br/><br/>In the 2004 version, younger players are not required to remove backward on the track if they draw a named card, and the last square of the track was changed from a Violet Square to a Rainbow Square, resolving a 55-year dispute over whether a player needs to land on the Violet Square or move beyond the Violet Square to win.<br/><br/>Prior to the 2006 version, three colored spaces on the track (one in Molasses Swamp and two &quot;Cherry Pitfalls&quot;) were marked with a dot.  Players who landed on a dot were &quot;stuck,&quot; and were unable to move from the spot until they drew a card that matched the color of the square they were on.  The 2006 version replaced gum drops with licorice spaces; players who land on a licorice space only lose their next turn.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Legend of the Lost Candy Castle&rdquo; is printed inside the box and can be read out loud.

The World Championships are held every two years, with the most recent event in Germany (30 May-1 June, 2019), and the next event planned for Netherlands (2021).<br/><br/>Playing involves each player having three rounds of sliding 30 wooden disks along a 2 metre long table in an attempt to get them through four arches numbered 1 to 4 at the other end. Getting disks into the low scoring compartments is just as important as the high ones because each set of 4 disks in the four compartments scores double (20 instead of 10 points).<br/><br/>Note that sjoelbak is the name of the board, not the game itself.<br/><br/>",1870,,,

On a 29&quot; x 29&quot; wooden board, players flick a large weighted disc (the striker) at smaller wooden discs (the carrom-men). The goal is to sink your 9 carrom-men (black or white), as well as the red Queen, in the four corner pockets. The first player or team to accomplish this collects points for the round (commonly called a &quot;board&quot;). A standard game of Carrom continues until one player has 25 points or 8 boards have been completed.<br/><br/>Carrom is typically played with powder, and some variations of the game use cues.  The most widely played form of 'proper' Carrom is supported by a world wide set of rules known as The Laws of Carrom, and are available from the International Carrom Federation.<br/><br/>Carrom bears similarities to Pool and Crokinole, but is a fascinating game in its own right with varied strategies and techniques. No one knows exactly where the game originated. It could have come from Bangladesh, Burma, Egypt, or Ethiopia, but most believe it originated in India.<br/><br/>Also see American Carrom and the European games in a similar vein, Korona and H-ring spel.<br/><br/>",0,,,

Players go around the board and buy cities, with infantry, subs, generals etc (rather than money). Once they have a set of any 2 cities in a county they can then build forts, which enables the fort owner to receive military units from other players who land on that city.<br/><br/>The game appears to originate from New Zealand during the war years. It was promoted in local and National New Zealand papers from 1941 to about 1947. The rules were printed by the Evening Post which was a New Zealand Newspaper publisher company. The advertised examples suggest that small coloured moulded playing pieces were included, although other metal button type tokens have been recorded.

The playing surface comprises 20 modular board units which are shuffled prior to play and therefore create a randomized labyrinth planet to be explored.  120 push-out cardboard tiles  represent hidden bonuses and hazards and three special dice decide the combat and range of movement. Exploration elements work well and ensure no two games are the same. Dressing the board with the rather fiddly little tiles each time a new part of the maze is uncovered can become tedious. The cumulative effect of collected weapons can render a lucky player almost invincible very quickly, with the chimp warriors soon becoming superfluous and little more than an irritation.<br/><br/>A reasonable strategic exploration game for the younger player.<br/><br/>",2001,,,

The catch is that the pieces all look identical; they are identified by a colored ring on their underside only.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move a piece forward, sideways or diagonally, possibly jumping over a single piece (a series of jumps is possible if the right gaps are present, as in Checkers).  When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.

A Push occurs when an Escort arrives short of another piece (Princes can't Push); what happens is that the Escort's remaining steps are transferred to the pushed piece --which may be an opposing piece or your own Prince.  The pushed piece's move must be in a straight line, in the direction dictated by the collision.  When the straight line isn't possible, deflection occurs as indicated in the rules.

Light moves first.  Capture is by landing on an opposing frog and is not mandatory.  The object of the game is to line up three frogs horizontally, vertically or diagonally in the Arena in such a way that the opponent cannot break it up (by capture) on his next move.  A draw occurs when both players are down to two frogs.<br/><br/>In advanced play, a frog that captures gets to move again, sort of like in Checkers.

Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.<br/><br/>In most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard (&quot;bird!&quot; &quot;scavenger!&quot; &quot;bird of prey!!&quot; &quot;raptor?&quot;) or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the &quot;sounds like&quot; hint - pretending to sew for the word &quot;so,&quot; for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct.

If a boat is captured by the pirates, the players have a chance to rescue the prisoners... at the cost of valuable time and supplies.<br/><br/>This cooperative game is played on a board which shows the route from Adventure Island back to the player's home town. Each player starts with a boat on Adventure Island, and two pirate ships are placed along the route. The game is played in turns. Each turn, a player rolls two dice, then choses one die to use for his own boat and one die to use for one of the pirate ships. Both are moved as many places forward as the selected die shows. At certain points, the player can have his ship take a hidden route, which is not used by the pirate ships.<br/><br/>If a pirate ship passes a boat, or if a boat passes a pirate ship, the boat is captured and placed on Pirates' Island. Other boats can free it if they manage to land on one of the rescue spaces on the track; the rescued boat is then returned to that same space.<br/><br/>When all boats have reached the home town, the players have won the game. However, if some ships are captured while all other ships have reached the home town, the players lose.<br/><br/>The difficulty level can be increased by giving each player two or three boats instead of one. The greatest challenge is the Grand Adventure, in which each player has three boats, there is a third pirate ship, and each player may hide on the hidden routes at most five turns during the game.<br/><br/>The 2011 AMIGO edition is part of its &quot;&Ouml;kologisch + Kooperativ&quot; (Ecological &amp; Cooperative) line of games.<br/><br/>",1991,,,

Moves are mandatory.<br/><br/>As in Morris, every time a three-piece alignment is formed (including vertical ones), this is a Mill and one opposing piece of the miller's choice is removed.

Players can have combat with each other if they land on the same space and can barter items with each other.<br/><br/>Success is dependent on your rooms turning up somewhere near you early on in the game.

5170,Doki,"['Pattern Building', 'Point to Point Movement']",['Abstract Strategy'],"This game is distantly related to the Mill game or Nine Men's Morris, in that the object is to make alignments of three pieces: each such alignment created removes one opposing piece (miller's choice).  You win when you've reduced the opponent to two pieces or put him in such a bind that he cannot move.  If both players become immobilized, a draw occurs.<br/><br/>The 5&times;6 board is set up by both players by plunking down each of their 12 pieces alternately.  Strategy is crucial during this phase.  The only restriction is that alignments of three cannot be formed during this phase.  Once all pieces are set up, on your turn you move one of your pieces one space horizontally or vertically (diagonals aren't allowed or considered).<br/><br/>Strategies are alluded to but not explained in the short rules.  Shan Ruwa (&quot;to drown&quot;) consists of setting up so as to force the opponent to place in positions that will aid the starting player and drown the opponent.  Conversely, Turi (&quot;to push&quot;) prevents the starting player from forming alignments and makes his opening move bad for him.<br/><br/>A mill is called here Doki (&quot;galloping horse&quot;).  It is a combination of five pieces such that you form an alignment on each leg of the back-and-forth motion of the fifth piece.

The first player to correctly deduce the rule scores big; God also scores based on how long it took for the players to figure the rule out.  God should not choose a rule that is so hard to find out that nobody does, because then he doesn't score.<br/><br/>Additionally, a player with an hypothesis can declare himself to be a &quot;prophet&quot; who can predict the results of the other player's experiments.  Other players can then try to bring about the overthrow of the prophet by trying to find experiments whose results cannot be predicted (falsification), thus gaining a chance to become prophet themselves.<br/><br/>A very simple rule would be &quot;Alternate between black and red cards&quot;.  A simple but hard to discover rule would be &quot;Alternate between cards which have closed loops in their number or letter designations (e.g. 4, Q), and cards which don't (e.g. 2, K)&quot;.<br/><br/>The game was first published in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column in June 1959.

(Boarding rules are similar to Battle Chips from Tim's Games.)<br/><br/>The campaign game can be played by four players - more if you photocopy player mats and don't mind people doubling up on roles.  With four, each person takes one of four roles: pirate, British privateer, merchant, Spanish galleoneer.  Each has different goals to win the game.  There is a simple map of the Caribbean with six ports (some British, some Spanish, some neutral, some cities, some towns, some villages) and two different sea zones.  You simultaneously select your destinations and reveal (you can't go directly from port to port - you must first go to one of the sea zones).  If you're in the same area as another player, there may be combat - use either basic or advanced ship-to-ship combat as described above.  Once that's resolved, roll on the encounter tables, modifying the result depending on if a port is hostile or friendly or neutral to you.

The game uses a unique system of movement for trucks, wartraks and bikes to locate riches and beat up rival mobs.

Enterprise, which is docked for repairs.<br/><br/>The players (watching the tape) see a renegade Klingon (named KAVOK) hijack the ship with only themselves aboard with him. He periodically appears on the television screen (which is a simulation of different communication view screens aboard the ship) and talks to the players during the game.<br/><br/>KAVOK's intention is to use the Federation ship to to attack the Klingon Empire and instigate a Federation/Klingon war. He also plans to gloriously die in battle along with the remaining crew. KAVOK will create setbacks and obstacles for the players as they attempt to gain access to the bridge and regain control of the ship. The journey to the Klingon Empire takes 60 minutes of real time game-playing (displayed on screen).

The lone exceptions are the four blue hexes on your side of the board --you may cross them freely, but your opponent cannot. The thirteen red hexes (&quot;gates&quot;), finally, are the game goals; you win by occupying five of these in a straight line. To enter a gate, you must start adjacent to it (except for the two gates adjacent to your base). Entering a gate (other than the two base ones) gives you a bonus move. Occupied gates are the only occupied spaces that can be jumped.<br/><br/>A hex is &quot;secured&quot; (the opponent cannot enter it) if surrounded by three or more of your pieces. Securing a hex captures any piece that happens to lie there (it is removed from the game and you get a bonus move). Finally, the fifth gate of any triangular set is secured if you occupy the first four.

5285,Pro Tennis,[],['Sports'],"Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.<br/><br/>To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.<br/><br/>Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.<br/><br/>The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.<br/><br/>Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.<br/><br/>And so it goes.<br/><br/>This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.<br/><br/>The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.<br/><br/>",1983,,,

The Visiting Team bats in the top half of each of the nine innings and the Home Team, in the bottom half. Runners move around the bases, and runs and innings are recorded on a stand-up scoreboard screen. The game uses a special deck of 54 cards, which represent typical baseball plays. When a manager&rsquo;s team is at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will help score runs. When not at bat, that manager will try to play cards that will result in outs for the other team.<br/><br/>The designer on his original edition: &quot;The scoring rules are simple and logical, and differ only slightly from the official rules of baseball. The elements of luck and skill are balanced carefully, so as to make each game an interesting and different contest.&quot;<br/><br/>The game includes rules for the Heirloom edition as well as the original 1962 rules, which contain instructions for playing with 3 or 4 players plus &quot;Slugfest&quot; and &quot;Shutout&quot; variants.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>Each player draws a hand of 3 cards, which when played will result in a play result. At the beginning of each half inning, the batting team plays a card for the first batter. The play is then resolved and the player draws a card to bring his hand back to three. The pitching team then plays a card to derive a result for the second batter and draws a card to replace into his hand. Play goes like this until three outs are made.<br/><br/>There are two different types of special cards in the game. Substitute cards, when drawn, are immediately played face up in front of the player drawing them, along with another card drawn from the deck and placed, unseen, on top of it. A player may use the substitute card as a &quot;pinch hitter&quot; or &quot;relief pitcher&quot; in the game when his hand does not have a useful card (i.e. a hit when he is at bat or an out when he is pitching). The substitute card is then flipped over and played.<br/><br/>Wild cards are those which only affect base runners and do not resolve an at bat (e.g. wild pitch, passed ball, stolen base, balk). When one of these cards is played, the result is noted, but then play passes back to the opponent, who will play a card to resolve the at bat.<br/><br/>After every three innings, both players return their hands to the deck, reshuffle the deck, and receive a new hand of three cards. After nine innings, whoever has the most runs is the winner.<br/><br/>",1962,,,

The first edition and second editions of the Epic system had each been released as two separate games. The first edition comprised Space Marine (1st ed) and Adeptus Titanicus. Second edition comprised Space Marine (2nd ed) and Titan Legions. For the 3rd edition of the Epic system GW decided to release it as a single game and that game was Warhammer Epic 40k. For this reason Epic 40K is also known as 3rd ed. Epic 40k absorbed both the Titan Legions and Space Marine rules into one system, reducing and streamlining the rules in both those games into one more concise and coherent system. Epic now has faster gameplay and less rulebook-reading during play.<br/><br/>It's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition) world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas.

These components represent the participants and locations of two ACW Confederate Cavalry engagements that involved the southern raider, General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The two battles, Brice's Crossroads and Tupelo, resulted from U.S. General William T. Sherman's campaign to remove Forrest as a threat to his flank and supply lines. Before the Union Army marched on Atlanta, Elements of Sherman's Army pursued Forrest, and others, into Mississippi and engaged his cavalry twice before its destruction at Tupelo.<br/><br/>All game-turns represent approximately 1 hour real time, and each Strength Point is the equivalent of 50 men or 1 gun. In Brice's Crossroads, the map scale is 115 yards per hex. In Tupelo the scale is 160 yards per hex.<br/><br/>This game is an excellent example of the, ever evolving, TSS/GBACW game system.

Each player has a hand of cards that are numbered from 0 to 3, plus a &quot;Battle&quot; card. To get a body, you play a &quot;war&quot;-like card game, blindly drawing one of your cards. The player with the highest card gets to choose from the four bodies available. The loser chooses from what is remaining. Next, the players bid for accessories, the armor and weapons. The loser of the body choice gets to choose the first accessory up for bid. Each robot has a specific set of armor that will fit it. If you lose the bid on it, you are at a severe disadvantage. However, your opponent will have had to use up bid cards and thus will have less for later auctions. You also can prevent your opponent from completing his robot by playing your &quot;Battle&quot; card in an auction. This gives the item up for bid to your opponent, but ends all bidding for accessories and sends you to the next stage of the game.<br/><br/>Once you have a robot and accessories for it, it is time to battle in the arena.

Hundreds of miles to the west, two powerful Soviet Fronts are moving west and south against a patchwork German line, intent on destroying the remaining Axis forces in Southern Russia. Operations Star and Gallop have begun.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, the shocked, battered remnants of these two Soviet Fronts are running for the collective lives from powerful German panzer spearheads. What had happened? Soviet overconfidence was responsible in part for the disaster, playing into German hands, but by far, most of the credit for the amazing reversal belonged to Field Marshal von Manstein. Holding off the Soviets to his front and Hitler at his back, he managed to accumulate sufficient panzer formations to allow the Germans to regain tactical and operational superiority.<br/><br/>Von Manstein's Backhand Blow is a low/intermediate complexity two player game using the well-received Turning the Tables system pioneered in earlier east front games produced by Moments in History. The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.<br/><br/>Dirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations.

Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.<br/><br/>The strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies.

5388,Golf Ace,['Simulation'],"['Card Game', 'Sports']","Golf Ace strives to simulate the intricacies of golf in a card game.<br/><br/>It comprises four boards, depicting golf holes of various lengths and bearing different hazards, two packs of (conventional) playing cards and comprehensive playing instructions including example holes for the novice to play through.   Each hole has a dominant suit (hearts, clubs, diamonds or spades) and a stroke is made by playing a combination of cards to determine the distance and lie.  Thus playing a 2 + King (picture cards count as 0 or 10) + Ace, equates to a drive of 201 yards. Only certain distances are permitted, as shown on a distance table on each board, and certain cards may land you in a hazard (which, tactically, may still be worth playing).  Playing a card not of the dominant suit incurs a one stroke penalty.  A player may opt to draw from the stock, in the hope of improving his position, or play a stroke with the cards he has been dealt.<br/><br/>Golf Ace works best with 4 players, but can be played as a solitaire, trying to beat your own lowest score for a round of 9 or 18 holes.<br/><br/>",1992,,,

It consists of simultaneous trading of various stocks, trying to get a majority.<br/><br/>Gameplay: A card is placed facedown in the center, and the remainder of the deck is dealt out.

You may also swap one of your cards with the central card. When a player obtains a majority of all the stock types they have in their hand (for example, 4 of the 7 green cards and 3 of the 5 blue cards), play stops and the round is scored.<br/><br/>Scoring: The player who stops the play gets +5 (or -5 if they don't have a majority after all). You get +2 for each stock card if you have a monopoly of that stock, and +1 per card if you have a majority but not all of them. Warning: You get -1 for each card in your hand that matches whichever stock is the central (bankrupt) card when the round ends.

Each player represents a family that buys up and develops large tracts of land. The area of settlement is 98 squares (9 x 11, with one square missing). Each family starts with a double-sized tile of each of the three land types - settlement, cropland, pasture. Tiles have undeveloped and developed sides; naturally, they start undeveloped.<br/><br/>In each round after the initial placement of the starting tiles, players bid for the right to buy more land tiles or development cards - up to two per round. A total of 9 combined tiles and cards are available each round for purchase. The advantage of bidding high (and thus paying more for each purchase) is that high bidders get the first choice, and the highest bidder gets to decide how many tiles and cards will be up for auction in the next round. Tiles or cards must be played immediately after purchase, unless barns are available to store cards (but not tiles) for later use. Those that can't be played may not be bought.<br/><br/>Development cards are of two kinds. One lets a player buy pilgrims (who generate shillings, the game's currency), barns (to store development cards) or ships (to add extra tiles or cards to those on offer). The other is needed to develop land tiles. Development is possible only if the player owns undeveloped tiles of the same type, number and configuration as shown on the card, e. g., three cropland tiles forming a right angle, two adjacent pastures or a square of four settlements.<br/><br/>Playing development cards earns victory points, the number depending on the difficulty of using the card. A square of tiles scores 10 points, while a pilgrim, barn or ship gains only one.<br/><br/>Play continues until there are too few cards and tiles left to stock a full auction. At that point, the players tally their victory points, adding bonuses for most pilgrims, barns or ships. The winner is the player with the most points; shillings are the tie breaker.<br/><br/>",2003,,,

The landing craft is placed on the scoring track.<br/><br/>The map tiles are mixed face-down, and an arbitrary card is put face-up on an arbitrary field of the game board. The card is oriented so that the two numbers each point to one of the sides of the board with the holes. Based on this tile, the coordinate stones are populated onto each side. First place the number corresponding to the tile, then fill in the rest of the side using numbers one through five consecutively. Players put their treasure chests, map tiles and guards behind their sight screen.<br/><br/>Each player has one of the following possibilities during his turn:<br/>- Take an open map tile and place it behind their screen;<br/>- Take a free guard and place it behind their screen;<br/>- Place a map tile or tiles on the board;<br/>- Place Treasure Chests on the board;<br/>- Place Guards on the board.<br/><br/>If a player scores he or she moves the corresponding landing craft on the scoring track. Players achieve points by placing map tiles, revealing buried treasures, guarding the treasure once discovered, and for ending the game. The game ends when a player has nothing behind their screen at the beginning of their turn.<br/>The winner is the player whose landing craft at the end of the game is furthest advanced on the score chart.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.<br/><br/>The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.<br/><br/>Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents' cities.<br/><br/>The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).<br/><br/>Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.<br/><br/>",2003,,,

All cards cost the same but have varying resale values (some are even worthless).  Complete sets are worth more, and some commodities are worth more than others.<br/><br/>Assassination can be attempted if you land on one of the two Assassination squares, on the same square as your victim, or once per go around the board if you have enough money (500 k$, forfeiting your turn to do so).  Hired Assassins come in three classes (A through C), the cheaper being less proficient in weaponry than the more expensive ones (A: five weapons; C: three weapons).<br/><br/>Assassinations are resolved by drawing an Assassin card and comparing it with a Location card; each location lists permissible weapons --if the assassin isn't proficient with at least one of those, too bad.  If he is, you draw a Weapon card to see if he managed to find/smuggle one of the needed weapons.  Assuming the three cards show a match, the designated weapon(s) lists a number that needs to be matched on the dice.  An assassinated player is eliminated.<br/><br/>To defend, you may offer 1 M$ to the player who ordered the assassination just before the dice are rolled, or you may hire an assassin of your own as a bodyguard.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

The player starts by rolling a dice, giving him a number that is the maximum moves that player can make during his turn. He may move any pieces he wants as long as their moves add up to or below the total rolled on the dice. All pieces move once for every dot on the dice except the King's Guard, who moves twice, never less, for each spot used.<br/><br/>This is played out on a chess board with a blue and a red team. Blue moves first. The objectives are either to kill the other King whilst protecting one's own (Eliminator) or just to kill every enemy piece on the board (Speed Eliminator). To perform a kill, your piece must leap frog another. If your piece passes over another - whichever team it belongs to - it is dead and removed from the board.<br/><br/>Each piece has a forward facing arrow on its head except the King's Guard. These show the directions the pieces are allowed to move in. The KG may move in any direction, but for the other pieces to change direction, the directional dice (which tells you which way to turn) must be rolled instead of the movement dice. The result of the roll must be adhered to with one of your pieces changing direction accordingly.<br/><br/>If a piece reaches the enemy's side, it recieves a cap that allows it to move in any direction. This cap is also a shield which can 'die' instead of the piece, should the piece be killed. If the piece lands infront of the King, the cap may be transfered, but the piece must remain in the direction it faces when the cap is removed.<br/><br/>A four player version has been developed and can be accessed from the link below, but email me at writer@philipstobbart.co.uk for the username and password before going for it!<br/><br/>",2003,,,

Games can be played using a timer or to a set number of points.<br/><br/>Many different versions of this game have been published over the last 50+ years.<br/><br/>Steel rods with metal gears were used before plastic ones, the plastic gear system was quickly abandoned as gears would not last. From there a curved spring was used (ImageID: 427829) from rod to player holding slider. This worked well for durability. This changed the game though considerably, as there was a bit of spring action in shooting. Slap shots were less powerful, but wrist shots worked better. Many different ice layouts were made for rod and player movement within the defined track segments. Swiveled tracks made players look like they were skating down the ice. This changed play and tactics for each game, it was considered having home ice advantage, as you were used to your game surface design. You knew how the puck bounced off the boards and where to exploit the best scoring chances. Various pucks were used, heavier ones worked better with the gear system, lighter ones worked better with the spring system.

A network of key points is laid over this map, with castles, ports and unfortified areas connected by roads. Troops move along these roads from point to point. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to conquer the Moorish kingdom - Granada herself and five other important Moorish sites. The Moorish player seeks to prevent this, or to force peace on the Spaniards by taking their key cities of Cordoba and Lorca.<br/><br/>Each player has troops with which to carry out these tasks - knights, cavalry, and foot soldiers plus warships. The Spanish player also has siege cannon. Both players have leaders to move their troops and assist them in battle, with Ferdinand for the Spaniards and Muhammed al-Zagal for the Moors being much better at this than other leaders.<br/><br/>In battle, both players place their units on a combat display and roll dice to determine how many &quot;hits&quot; are achieved. Four hits will eliminate most units. The best units in the game are the Moorish Jund armored cavalry and the fanatic Spanish Knights of Santiago and Calatrava. A well-manned castle is very difficult to capture, but the Spanish siege guns can make an enormous difference. At sea, the Spanish player is trying to deny the Moor reinforcements from Africa. Many Moorish troops are volunteers from overseas, who must arrive at ports. The Moor can also gain aid from the Ottoman Empire, but only if he or she has kept the ports open.<br/><br/>",2003,,,
5454,Canadian Checkers,[],['Abstract Strategy'],"This game, played mainly in Quebec, is different enough from Checkers to be called a distinct game. It is played on a 12 x 12 board of 144 squares with 30 pieces on a side.<br/><br/>Un-promoted pieces can capture forward or backward. A promoted piece (queen) moves like a chess bishop, and can capture a piece anywhere along its line of movement.<br/><br/>One of the rules that set it apart from Draughts and Checkers is Compulsory Capturing. Once begun, you must take all the pieces you are able without stopping short. To do so means the forfeiture of your piece. This can be a strategic move but trying it more than once during a tournament is not advisable.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Checkers Family<br/><br/>",0,,,

If you choose to do so, you roll the 0 dice in the hope of getting more 1s...But if you roll no 1s, you lose your turn and any 1s rolled previously.  Hence the Temptation.  If you manage to get five 1s, you place five caps (see below) and take another turn.<br/><br/>The caps won must be placed in a straight orthogonal line, adjacent to at least one previously placed cap.  You lose the caps won if you can't place them.  You may even cap off part of another player's grid --this helps him somewhat, but may make the rest of his grid harder to cap off, by breaking up the pattern.<br/><br/>When playing multiple rounds, the winner of a round scores the other players' remaining cap spaces.<br/><br/>",1990,,,

If he's captured, you lose.<br/>On your turn, you get four dice rolls, which can be used to move (orthogonally) or shoot to capture. You must announce each attempt *before* rolling the dice. Each piece can normally move and/or shoot only once (except Cruisers, who can shoot again if they miss).<br/><br/>The board is divided into two colors of zones, and this affects shooting and movement. Captured pieces can be freed if you reach the holding Prison Outpost. Having one's Mother Ship captured is real bad because it does not go to the Prison Outpost --it is removed altogether!<br/><br/>Every time you capture (including ships in one of a Mother Ship's launching bays), you get a bonus roll; basically, the shot that just occurred doesn't count against your four rolls.

The trick is, if you play a Wasp in response to being zapped by a wasp, then the opponent to your left must draw 2 cards equal to the numbers of wasp cards in the stack, unless your opponent plays a wasp which would make the next player draw even more cards unless HE also played a wasp, etc.<br/><br/>It's not uncommon for players to quickly draw huge handfuls of cards. There is a nice  balancing mechanism however. If you can match an identical card that someone just played you can &quot;match&quot; the player by quickly discarding the card. The player who played the original card must draw one card and play passes to the next player from the person who laid the Match. So the more cards you have in your hand, the more matches you can make to get rid of them.<br/><br/>Zar has a faster pace than UNO and constantly keeps you on toes to match your opponent's cards.

Action cards provide game play strategy that allows players to introduce viruses (represented by tokens) onto their opponent&rsquo;s Object cards. You can&rsquo;t win unless you have 10 Object cards on your side with no virus tokens on them. Other Action cards shield your Objects from viruses (like Anti Virus), and help to clean virus tokens off your Object cards (Cleanup). There are Action cards that allow you to steal a card from another player (Piracy), remove anti-virus protection (AV Killer), or that pesky Virus Generator card (Scan), or search for a card in the discard pile (Backup). Some Action cards like Virus!, Recycle or Repair use a 6-sided die to determine how many virus tokens are placed or removed from your Object cards. This adds an aspect of chance to the game, and helps make every game you play different.<br/><br/>A more attainable goal of playing to just 6 virus-free objects is recommended by some players.<br/><br/>",2001,,,
5498,Maltese,"['Hand Management', 'Set Collection']","['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game']","Maltese uses tiles in an original rummy-type game in which completing sets can enable players to force tiles out of their opponent's hands.<br/><br/>Tiles come in 5 colors, and each tile has an inset in any of those same 5 colors.  Half of the insets will match the tile's exterior, half won't.  So, for example, of the 16 green tiles, 8 have green insets, 2 have orange, 2 have white, 2 have read, and 2 have blue.<br/><br/>All players can see the external color of a tile, but only the owner sees its inset - and the inset color is what really counts.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player has a tile holder (&quot;shield&quot;) which holds the tiles in 5 rows.  When playing into this section of the shield, all the tiles in a row must be a single color (inset), and each row must be a different color.  So you'll have one row that is all-white, one that is all-red, etc, but you can choose which is which.  Furthermore, each row contains a different # of tiles, from 1-5.  The goal is to completely fill in this section of your shield: a total of 5 matched rows with a total of 15 tiles.<br/><br/>A typical turn involves choosing a tile randomly, placing it into your hand, and then moving one tile from your hand into the central, scoring, part of the shield.  There are two key moves that occur.  One is when you complete a row.  At this point, you announce ALL UNFINISHED ROWS OF THAT SAME INSET COLOR GO BACK TO THE ARMORY (Draw pile).  This is where both the varying # of tiles, and the limited information are crucial.  You could, for example, play a single green tile in your &quot;#1&quot; row - and complete it.  If an opponent is working on a larger green row that is incomplete, he may have to discard as many as 4 green tiles.  You know that half of the green exterior tiles are green - so you only have limited information as to which of your opponents' rows might be green, or if they are even working on any green rows.<br/><br/>The second attack move occurs when you complete a row that is entirely &quot;matched&quot; (Insert color matches exterior color).  You can even do this by replacing unmatched tiles with matched tiles in rows you've already completed.  You then announce ALL FINISHED BUT UNMATCHED ROWS OF THAT SAME ROW NUMBER ARE BACK TO THE ARMORY.  In this case, if you complete a matched #3 row, all opponents who have completed unmatched #3 rows must toss all of these three tiles back into the draw pile.<br/><br/>Game ends when the first player completes all 5 rows with 5 different colors - matched or not.<br/><br/>",1977,,,

The combat rules are more streamlined than that of Morheim, and the campaign game is more fleshed out.  You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.<br/><br/>Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.<br/><br/>RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and &quot;Reptiliads&quot; (lizard men) to name a few.

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.<br/>Another important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best.

Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO.

For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card. These are the rarer &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; edition of the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards.<br/><br/>Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.<br/><br/>Two different series exist: the UK version and the US version. The US series had 139 cards in the basic series plus eight chase treasure cards (T1-T8). US #140 was the Emperor of Vangoria, not available in packs but redeemed by mailing in all 8 treasure cards (and effectively &quot;winning&quot; the game). The #140 card was available in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; chased versions like the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by completing the Emperor quest using Gold and Silver 'Wondrous Treasure' cards. US cards were standard US trading card sized with gold scratch-offs and an eggshell finish. The UK series had 149 basic cards as the 8 treasure cards were numbered within the basic set, plus there were two additional strategy cards not included in the US set. The UK Emperor was #150, again only acquired by redeeming all 8 treasure cards. UK cards are larger than the US cards, have a gloss finish and silver scratch-offs.

Fuel consumption is basically one unit every time the die is rolled, and running out of fuel can force a landing at an emergency air field or cause a pilot to bail out.<br/><br/>The game is interesting because of the scale plastic planes used as playing pieces (actual reproductions of the F-105) and in the cardboard 'control panels' which players use to keep track of altitude and fuel.

This  simple mechanic balances the game by spreading the attacks around as you can't attack someone that can't pay the Peril price.<br/><br/>Players attempt various quests (some are simple die rolls in a certain room, some are tough combat and some a series of things to do), with each completed quest having your Hero &quot;go up a level&quot; which increases his abilities.<br/><br/>Treasures &amp; Boons help you, Banes, Traps &amp; Encounters hurt you (which are played on you by other players).<br/><br/>The dungeon map is different each time as it is made up of cards played one at time onto the table by each player.<br/><br/>This game was introduced at DunDraCon 2003, in San Ramon, Ca.

But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).<br/><br/>Action dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay.

Before each phase, horses are auctioned off to the players; each player gets 2, 4 or 6 horses depending on the number of players. After each phase, players can keep only one horse from the preceding phases, the rest are auctioned off again. Auction is followed by training which is played on a short &quot;training track&quot; on the game board; here the horses can get better - each horse has a value from -5 to +5 which will help/hinder in the roll-and-move race - and the players may also get cards for later use during the actual race.<br/><br/>Results of the training define starting positions for the race and also give some clue as to each horse's capabilities, so now it's time for betting. A player can bet on up to 2-3 horses, depending on the number of players; betting is secret, and a player can freely bet on any horses, including their opponents'.<br/><br/>The actual race is conducted as roll-and-move using 2 dice. A special die is used for moving the horses, adding or subtracting their individual modifiers, and a regular d6 is used to determine if a player must pick a race card (on 1 or 6). These affect the race directly and often quite drastically; some may be saved for later use.<br/><br/>After the race the winning horse gets it's modifier increased by one step, all bets are revealed, money paid out from the bank and preparations made for the next race. Horses that competed in a race may not compete in the immediate next one - this is why the players have several. After the 2nd and 4th races, the auction phase is repeated.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a bonus is paid to players who managed to bet on the winning horse in 5 or 6 races, any bank loans are paid back, and winner is the player with most money.<br/><br/>Approximate play sequence:<br/><br/>1) Auction - buy a number of horses<br/>2) Train them for the race<br/>3) Select horses for race 1<br/>4) Betting phase<br/>5) Run short race<br/>6) Pay winner, both race and betting money.<br/>7) Repeat 3-6, but with long race<br/>8) repeat 1-6 twice<br/>9) Pay bonus to anyone who has picked the winner in at least 5 of the 6 races.<br/><br/>",1982,,,

Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.<br/><br/>From the designer:<br/>Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him.

9627,Four Square,['Memory'],"['Card Game', 'Memory', 'Number']","FOUR SQUARE is a fast-moving game that's easy to learn. It's sort of a combination of concentration and rummy. The three face card characters in the deck represent the qualities that help to win. They are  LUCK,   BRAINS,  and  COURAGE.  It takes  LUCK  to draw the right card at the right time, BRAINS  to remember cards you only see once, and  COURAGE  to save for a FOUR SQUARE call. The objective is to go out early and catch your opponents with big counts in their hands. There are two ways to go out. One is to  KNOCK,  betting that you have the lowest hand around the table. The other is to build a hand with four-of-a-kind. During the play, hands are kept face down on the table and arranged in a square, hence the name &quot;FOUR SQUARE.&quot; In either case, the losing players' scores are increased by the number of the points in their hands, in some cases doubled or tripled, as later described. The game continues until at least one player has a total score of 100 or more. The player with the lowest score is the winner. In case of a tie, the winners share the honor.<br/><br/>",1984,,,

Players also have a hand of tarot cards which allow them to use those powers through any of their pieces. Territories are worth points when occupied, and the game ends when one player challenges the other players and has 9 points on his or her following turn.<br/><br/>Gnostica is a redevelopment of Zarcana.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by Zark City, and Dectana.

Each player gets a large ball that fits on the hole in the pieces, and the starting position is determined based on the number of players (2-4).<br/><br/>With the goal being to get your ball onto the center tower, you progress by moving your ball anywhere on the same level you start and then placing another piece on an adjacent space (adding a level to that space.) You can move down the structure for free as long as you don't skip a level, but once you move onto a higher level in your turn it is over.

Self-published, it has come in various boxes over the years, from cigar boxes to blue and silver cardboard.<br/><br/>Each team (or individual player when playing with a smaller group) rolls a 12-sided die. For 1-3, a Red question is asked, for 4-6 a Green one, for 7-9 a Yellow one, and for 10-12 a Blue one. Each question is worth the number rolled on the die.<br/><br/>The questions are devilishly hard and sometimes feature trick questions. Examples: Which part, the bowl or the grinder, is the mortar? In medieval times, the first hay cut in the season was called the Math. What was the second cut called? (Answer: Aftermath) Most deal with word origins and obscure knowledge. Each card also features a small tidbit of information about the answer.<br/><br/>The first player or team to get to 31 points is the winner. Replay value of the game is somewhat limited since only a single question set was ever produced, but the game is well worth picking up.

9674,Einfach Genial,"['Hand Management', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Pattern Building', 'Team-Based Game', 'Tile Placement']",['Abstract Strategy'],"In Ingenious, a.k.a. Einfach Genial, players take turns placing colored domino-style tiles on a game board, scoring for each line of colored symbols that they enlarge. The trick, however, is that a player's score is equal to their worst-scoring color, not their best, so they need to score for all colors instead of specializing in only one or two.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two conjoined hexes; each hex has one of six colors in it, with most tiles having different-colored hexes. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it, and on a turn a player places one tile from their rack onto two hexes of the game board. For each hex on this tile, they score one point in that color for each hex of the same color that lies adjacent to it and each hex in a straight line from it. If a player brings the score of a color to 18, they immediately take another turn. At the end of their turn, they refill their rack to six tiles. (Before refilling their rack, if they have no tiles on it that contain hexes in their lowest-scoring color, they can discard all of their tiles, then draw six new tiles from the bag.)<br/><br/>When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.<br/><br/>Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play; in the latter case, two teams of two play, with each player not being able to see their partner's tiles and teams keeping a combined score that maxes out at 36 instead of 18.<br/><br/>",2004,,,
9675,La Strada,"['Action Points', 'Area Majority / Influence', 'Enclosure', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Network and Route Building', 'Tile Placement']","['Abstract Strategy', 'Transportation']","The route-building game genre can be counted as the greatest passion of English game designer and history teacher Martin Wallace. And with La Strada, he has come up with a particularly clever road-building game. Everything &ndash; from the rules to the game play &ndash; is devilishly simple. The game lets players claim successes throughout the game, and turn-by-turn one reaches one or even multiple goals. But at the end, someone else wins? How did that happen?<br/><br/>The game features a variable game board, built up out of hex tiles that depict easily traveled flatland, forests, or hills. Before the start of the game, nineteen different settlements (ranging from cities to tiny villages) with varying victory point values are randomly placed onto those spaces featuring a gray symbol. Each player then places his or her starting marker onto a chosen flatland tile. The object here is of course to try to put your starting marker near as many high-value cities as possible.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to connect together as many settlements with your roads as possible, in order to get as many victory points as possible. The catch is that settlements award fewer and fewer victory points the more players connect to them. The cities are like pies: the more people want a slice, the smaller the slices have to be.<br/><br/>Building streets is very simple. One a player&rsquo;s turn, he receives six gold pieces. Each street segment costs two gold to build over flatland, three over forest, and four over hills. Players can build as many segments as they can afford on their turn, provided that they end at a settlement and don&rsquo;t intersect any other streets on the way. Put simply: players can&rsquo;t end a street in the middle of nowhere and then keep building next turn. Streets have to reach their destination at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Once a settlement has been reached, and then the player gets to put one of their trade markers on it. Note that streets can intersect each other only at the settlement locations. If a player doesn&rsquo;t use up all of his gold on his turn, then he can save it for the next turn (where he will also get another six gold to play with again). Players aren&rsquo;t allowed to spend more than ten gold pieces on their turn, though, so you can&rsquo;t save forever.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player can&rsquo;t build any more roads or doesn&rsquo;t have any trade markers left.<br/><br/>Scoring then occurs. A scoring example for a city: The city is worth five victory points, but only if it was connected to by a single player. A doubly connected city is worth four points for each player, while a triply connected city is only worth three each. Cities connected to by four players are only worth two points. This decreasing point system also counts for smaller settlements, worth between four and two victory points. A nicely thought out sorting system ensures that the end game scoring doesn&rsquo;t turn into a math exercise. Naturally, the player with the most victory points is the winner. In the case of a tie, then the tied player with the most gold left is the winner.<br/><br/>La Strada is a very simple game: build roads and connect cities. But it&rsquo;s not that easy to get ahead with the scores. It&rsquo;s every player&rsquo;s dream to claim a fat five point city all to themselves &ndash; but a player who spends too much energy trying to protect an investment will find that his other road-building options become tighter.<br/><br/>[Text is from a preview by Spielbox]<br/><br/>",2004,,,

9677,Exorbitare,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Roll / Spin and Move']",['Abstract Strategy'],"The game is based on the energy levels within an atom, and it is played on a board representing the Periodic Table of the Elements.  The squares making up the orbits are numbered according to the atomic numbers of the elements from Hydrogen (1) to radon (86).<br/><br/>The number of counters a player has depends on the number of players.  Two players have eight counters each, three players have six counters each, and four players have four counters each.<br/><br/>Players take turns to roll both dice.  The scores obtained on the dice may be used as a total, or as individual dice scores, to move the player's pieces to their best advantage.  For each six thrown, the player may move one piece into play, and roll that dice again.  The player does not have to move a piece into play unless he or she has no pieces in play already.<br/><br/>The players move their pieces along the track until they complete a circuit and land directly on a jump square.  When a piece lands on a jump square it is elevated to the next highest quantum level.  When a piece moves up a level, the controlling player gets an extra roll of one dice.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on the same square as an opponent's piece, Blatting occurs.  The piece that is Blatted moves down one energy level whilst the piece doing the Blatting moves up a level.  If a player's piece passes an opponents piece, Zapping occurs.  The piece that is Zapped moves down one energy level, but the piece that Zapped it does not move up.  A piece that is Zapped can Blat any piece that it lands on.  Thus both Blatting and Zapping are subject to chain-reaction.<br/><br/>To win the game a Quantum Jump must be achieved.  This is done by having a piece positioned on the yellow flash square, situated in the fourth energy band, at the same time as there are exactly half the total available number of player-counters in play.<br/><br/>",1981,,,

Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.<br/><br/>Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on &quot;BYU Square&quot;, pay $15,000, then proceed to the &quot;Temple Square&quot;).<br/><br/>When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.<br/><br/>Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the &quot;Interview Square&quot;.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.<br/><br/>The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.

Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On &quot;Tagete's&quot; day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Each player has 8 pawns representing &quot;Haruspexes&quot; [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to &quot;Lasa Vecuvia&quot; with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set &quot;passages&quot; on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.<br/><br/>Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or &quot;passage&quot; spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 &quot;neutral&quot; colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.<br/><br/>At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must &quot;sacrifice&quot; 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.<br/><br/>If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to &quot;seal&quot; the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors<br/>4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners<br/>1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games<br/>1 full color illustrated rules booklet<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Physical factors balance out.  Each team is exactly equal in power, speed and proficiency. Children&rsquo;s Hour 2-4<br/><br/>There are twelve Offense Cards and nine Defense Cards. Each players chooses a card secretly. The player on offense then declares whether the play action will take place on the weak side or strong side. The player on offense rolls three six-sided dice and the player on defense rolls two six-sided dice. The die rolls are modified by the play choices and the resulting yardage is the modified offensive roll minus the modified defensive roll.

These are games that both teenage and older players can enjoy.  Having military experience is no advantage-- the methods of play are definite, decisive and easily mastered.&quot;<br/><br/>The game board, while rudimentary, includes rivers, mountains, high ridges, railroads, roads, streams, towns and cities.  Each side has a number of counters representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, locomotives and headquarters, each with varying strength and movement capabilities.  The pieces are identified by number only (i.e., an infantry piece has a #4 on its face, and an artillery piece has a #2).  Movement is affected by terrain, as is battle strength.  The Union army wins the main game by retaining control of Chattanooga and capturing Atlanta.  The Confederates win by holding Atlanta.<br/><br/>The game is interesting in part because of its publication date.  There wasn't much competition for Avalon Hill in the early 60s, but fans of Avalon Hill's early games will immediately recognize elements of this one.<br/><br/>",1960,,,

The game also features a novel movement system using a series of terrain dice.<br/><br/>Runebound is playable solo and the first edition was updated with a 2nd Edition in 2005 (only 1 year after its release).<br/><br/>Runebound 1st Edition is different from 2nd Edition in that the original game featured a d20 and this was replaced by two 10-sided dice in the 2nd edition, which helped to better balance the luck factor.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Play of game continues until the Old Commie Bank goes broke &amp; all properties have been transferred to Private Ownership. The richest capitalist wins the game&quot;.<br/><br/>Similar to monopoly, players roll dice to move an auctioneer token (airplane) to a property. The player who is the auctioneer rotates counterclockwise each turn. Depending on the property, it is either taken outright by the auctioneer, sold to the highest bidder in a free auction, or sold to the bidder whose bid is closest to a hidden die roll. Landing on an owned property requires paying the owner a fee based on a die roll. Multiple properties of a given color multiply the fee. The player to the right of the auctioneer is the KGB (red car) and attempts to get to the property that the auctioneer is at (using die roll) to steal any proceeds or fees.<br/><br/>Players can also obtain escape cards to foil the KGB, or black market cards that provide special benefits.<br/><br/>",1991,,,

He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:<br/><br/>One number which is the combined value of both dice.<br/><br/>Or...<br/><br/>Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.<br/><br/>The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)<br/><br/>The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp; 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to &quot;shut the box&quot; you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.<br/><br/>In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score.

Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds fired at the target, and the speed of the firing and target platforms.<br/><br/>Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical hits are a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits are typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon mounts).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces. In addition to the well known battles such as Port Arthur, Yellow Sea, and Tsushima Strait, several smaller battles are included.

And unlike some Monopoly-like games, this one definitely ends when one of the draw piles are empty.<br/><br/>You start the game with &euro;150,000 and that's all the money you get from the bank. No beauty contests to win here, so you'd better spend them wisely. You will get cards with collectible items, though. And the item value increases the more items you have in the collection. So getting lots of cards in one collection is good, but naturally there is a risk - each collection can possibly be fake and worth nothing. This is controlled by the Insider Information cards which sometimes are available for auction in the game.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the game is the trading part. If you put cards down on the table, they are always for sale, and if an opponent happens to land on Trade, he can buy a category from you (for the market value). However, you can never lose money on showing your cards, but your opponent may increase his collection and therefore earn more - unless they are fake, of course.<br/><br/>The final balancing aspect is that the cards that you don't show are not declared properly, so if you land on Tax Razzia, you have to pay for those cards.<br/><br/>There are also bank-controlled auctions.<br/><br/>Speculation is a very well balanced, exciting and different economic game and you don't know for sure who's the winner until it's all over.<br/><br/>The game is in Swedish and scales well from three to five players.

9987,Rocky,['Simultaneous Action Selection'],"['Fighting', 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Sports']","The premise behind the game is matching one boxer and his Action Cards versus the other boxer and his Action Cards. Within each round of boxing each player will FLIP over 8 cards, one at a time, at the same time. Upon flipping each card both players should state the boxing move and the point total out loud. The higher number indicates which boxer wins the exchange. Each time a boxer wins an Exchange he gets closer to gaining a knockdown and closer to winning the round. To signify the winner of an exchange, advance the pawn one notch along the championship belt towards your opponent's KO area.<br/><br/>",1985,,,
9988,Solferino 1859,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']","Solferino portrays the final battle of the Second Italian War of Independence, a nominal French victory that persuaded Napoleon III to make peace without much attention to the aims of his Italian allies. It was the last battle in Europe (maybe in the world) in which three monarchs commanded armies: the little Napoleon for the French, Victor Emmanuel for the Sardinians and Franz Joseph I for the Austrians.<br/><br/>The scale is 600 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn. Units are infantry and cavalry brigades and corps-level artillery batteries. Units are rated for attack strength, movement factor and cohesion, which represents both morale and the number of losses that the unit can take before dissolving (2 for most infantry and cavalry, 3 for a few, 1 for artillery). Stacking is limited to one unit of any type plus one additional artillery unit per hex. Facing is of no importance for movement but does affect combat: Units may attack only through their 3 front hexes and are penalized if attacked from the flank or rear.<br/><br/>Command and control are of great importance. Most units are attached to higher level formations (corps for the French and Austrians, divisions for the Italians). A unit is in command only if it is within range of its corps/division headquarters and the HQ either is within range of its monarch or passes an initiative test. Out-of-command units aren't helpless but are barred from entering hexes adjacent to enemy units' fronts. The royal and imperial personages, particularly Victor Emmanuel and Franz Joseph, are not very mobile, thus limiting forward movement in what is essentially a huge meeting engagement.<br/><br/>The movement sequence uses the &quot;chit pull&quot; mechanism. Activation chits for each formation (plus a chit for each side representing all of its unattached units) are placed into a cup and drawn to determine which corps's or division's units may move next. The player who wins the initiative (usually the French) has the slight advantage of being able to select the first formation that will move each turn, without having to draw.<br/><br/>Combat is somewhat unusual, employing a system that makes attacks hard and bloody. The attacker's strength is compared to the defense value of the terrain occupied by the defender (1 for clear hexes, 2 for woods, villages and upper slopes, 3 for towns); the defender's strength doesn't matter. At first glance, the combat results table looks very favorable. There are two catches: First, unless an HQ stacks with one of the attackers and passes an initiative test, attacks cannot be combined. The brigades go in one by one. Second, the defender gets to use its own strength for defensive fire against each successive attack before the attacker may fire. A not untypical result of an uncoordinated attack is that each attacker in turn suffers disorder and is forced to fall back without doing any damage. Coordinated attacks work much better - the defender must divide its strength among the attacking units, while they get to add theirs - but, as noted, require the presence of an HQ, which risks the loss of its commander in the process. (He will be replaced, but by a less effective subordinate.) Artillery can help by softening up the target, but there aren't a lot of batteries. (Most of the guns present are abstractly incorporated in the infantry brigade strengths.). Worse yet, they move slowly, have trouble obtaining good lines of sight and are easily eliminated if they get too near the enemy.<br/><br/>As the battle goes on, formations will become demoralized through the loss of more than half of their initial steps. Once demoralized, they can do little except retreat off the field.<br/><br/>Players gain a Victory Point for occupying each of 7 towns and one for every two enemy corps or divisions demoralized. A side can also win instantly by eliminating the enemy Emperor (Napoleon or Franz Joseph), though only a rather careless player will expose his monarch to attack.<br/><br/>The battle starts at dawn (5:00 am) and will usually end abruptly in the late afternoon when a thunderstorm sweeps the field. If the storm holds off, the last turn is 6:00 pm. Whether or not it arrives, oppressive heat almost certainly will, slowing units and lowering their morale.<br/><br/>This game was announced as the first of the series, and a later issue of Vae Victis had a pair of sequels, covering the battles of Magenta (1859, the other big battle of the same war) and Reichshoffen (1870, Franco-Prussian War). There were, however, no more, either because the difficulties of attack frustrated aggressive players or simply owing to a lack of widespread interest in mid-19th Century European wars. Solferino gives us a glimpse of what the American Civil War might have been like if every general had been a McClellan.<br/><br/>",2004,,,
