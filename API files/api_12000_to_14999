On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards, and activate buildup cards.<br/><br/>In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.<br/><br/>By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.<br/><br/>The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.<br/><br/>The game's attraction lies with the many special cards. Many different combinations are possible during the game, and each game plays out differently as a result.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

They explore, using a new movement mechanic, for the raw materials they need to build the settlement. Along the way, they discover useful natural products - but also encounter wild animals and are confronted with adventurous situations. Those who survive these encounters obtain the raw materials they sought as well as experience points that improve the abilities of the player's character. Over time, then, the player becomes stronger, smarter or more charismatic and is better and better suited for the dangers of the wild.<br/><br/>Back in the village, the natural products can be used to brew beverages while the raw materials are used for building. Through this building, the settlement grows and players obtain victory points.<br/><br/>The main attraction of the game lies in the exploration of the island and the development of the individual player characters. But trading and interaction between the players is also important.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

The two transportation types are trains and ships. For example, 2 ship cards are required to travel from Suez to Bombay, so 2 ship cards must be played; train cards won't help in this instance. Time is spent each step of the way in the form of days, and (while meeting certain other requirements) the winner is the player who spends the fewest number of days getting around the world.

The small British force had only obsolete aircraft to defend with and opposed by 5000 Iraqi troops. However, the Iraqi morale was low and it was hoped that the Luftwaffe would change this. Thus, began a month long battle. Hitler was preoccupied with events and only agreed to sent a &quot;token&quot; force to support the Iraqis commanded by Captain Junck.

It is the first part of my Battles for Alamein game set, and it is an ideal introductory game for the hex-and-counter game format.<br/><br/>It uses archaic (but surprisingly realistic) combat mechanics with &quot;active Zones of Control&quot; requiring combat - except of Allied units already in brigade boxes/fortifications - which can be taken and eliminated.<br/><br/>The icons/figures on the pieces are by my older son Robert, who was also the playtester to the point of helping me design the game.  (We have played it hundreds of times together, even in video telephone conversations.)  Graphics guru Patrick Tremoureux has used those to produce professional quality map and units.<br/><br/>The scale of the game is: 1 day of real time per (10) game-turn(s), approximately 6 miles/10 kilometers per hexagonal space width, and brigade-to-division (8,000-15,000 men) unit scale, which amounts to 12 ground units on each side.

12027,Tolstoi: Wieviel Erde braucht der Mensch?,[],['Territory Building'],"The first (?) game based on a Tolstoi short story (&quot;How Much Ground Does a Man Need?&quot;), this game's premise is simple:  Two to four people have paid 1000 Rubles to the Bashkirs for a &quot;day&quot; of land.  How much is a &quot;day&quot;?  Well, you start on a mountaintop and begin walking.  If you come back to the mountain by sundown, you get all the land you encircle.<br/><br/>The board is a 24x32 grid.  Each player drops a small cylinder to indicate their starting location, and then draw cards (generally) to move.  Each card indicates how far and in what direction you move (your &quot;boundary&quot; is indicated by plastic cones in your color) and how much time it took--around the board, a Sun token moves from Dawn to Dusk.  When the Sun token hits Dusk, the game is over.  If you end up back on your mountain, you get points equal to the area you have enclosed (plus how many spaces are in your boundary--for the Go-enabled, it's &quot;Chinese scoring&quot;).

Stand a rectangle up so it's tall, then cut a very wide and short triangle out of one side, and that's the basic shape.<br/>The board has a number of odd features.  The center of it is a square that sinks down slightly into a square piece of black foam.  This is where the die and player pieces rest when the game isn't being played.  Around the center of the board is a narrow track with black and white arrows that can be flipped horizontally to show an arrow pointing in the opposite direction.  In one direction, the arrow is black and the background is white... in the other direction, the colors are reversed.  Each corner of the board has a tiny colored slot for the appropriate player piece to rest just before start... however, the groove isn't very deep at all and it's easy for the tall pieces to get knocked out.<br/>The game is very simple.  Two players take a clockwise route along one side of the track, and two others take a counterclockwise route along the other side.  A player rolls a die, and moves his piece the appropriate number of spaces.  If the final resting place for his piece is on a spot where the arrow is turned the wrong way, he must move back to the closest arrow that points in the proper direction, and then flips any arrows he wishes on the board equal to the number rolled on the die.  The first player that makes a full circle around the board and lands on or passes his starting point wins.<br/><br/>",1971,,,

The board is a fairly impressive 3-D cardboard creation that takes a few minutes to set up.  When assembled, the board is four levels high.  Bottom level is the main board and players start in the middle of each side on their home spaces.  There are two stairways with bridges to the second level--a ring of spaces that sits above the center of the board.  The third level is a smaller ring set above this one.  Fourth level is a single space that sits above this.  Baron Karza, the bad guy, starts on level four.  If the characters land on certain spaces, they check the &quot;Intruder Control&quot;--a cardboard dial with its face hidden by a movable window.  They turn the dial however they wish, then open the window to see if Karza stays where he is, or teleports to one of four numbered spaces on the board.  Players must land on Karza's space by exact count to capture him.  Players may also land on their opponents' spaces, forcing said opponents to return to their starting space.<br/><br/>",1978,,,

The other new kind of piece are the Champions, which are located in the corners of the 10x10 square, with a Pawn in front of them (there are ten in total) and a Tower to their side. The remaining pieces - that are also found on a traditional 8x8 square - are between the Champions and their Pawn, arranged as usual.<br/><br/>Similarly to the Knight, the new pieces are classified as leapers, which allows them to jump over pieces. A Champion can jump two squares in all eight directions. The Wizard can either jump three squares straight and then one square to either side, or move one square diagonally. Except for Pawns, standard pieces move as usual. Pawns are also allowed to move three squares from their initial position. As with moving two squares at once, they can be captured en passant when doing so.<br/><br/>",1992,,,

It depicts the attack by the German 57th Panzerekorps to open a corridor to the 6th Army, trapped in the Stalingrad Kessel. The fierce battle, that took place between December 12-23, 1942, was not a foregone conclusion.

THE DEVIL'S TO PAY explores a little known, but quite plausible, alternate chain of events turning on one such small incident.<br/><br/>Longstreet's scout Harrison ends up swinging from an apple tree, festooned with one of John Buford's famous 'let him hang for 7 days' notes. Bereft of the knowledge that the AoP is NORTH of the Potomac and hot in pursuit, General Lee simply continues as before for a few days longer, with his 3 Corps following the orders that he had already historically given them. Ewell attacks the Harrisburg defenses, which fall after a day or so. The bridges are burned, but with the shallow water and fords, the city itself is taken a couple of days later (helped by Jenkins' taking of the Rockville RR bridge to the north). However, the Pa Reserves (Crawford's Division) have been rushed north from the Washington defenses, and with their help Couch has drawn a defensive line along the Swatara Creek, a few miles to the east of Harrisburg. Early moves north from York along the Harrisburg Pike, which follows the river from York Haven. Hill, and then Longstreet follow Ewell down the Cumberland Valley (to the NE) towards the Pennsylvania capitol. By July 2nd, the Confederate Army is badly strung out; Ewell has two of his Divisions (Rodes &amp; Johnson) across the Susquehanna, with the third (Early) holding the West Shore. Hill is a couple of miles west in Mechanicsburg/Shiremanstown with Anderson's Division, while Heth and Pender's Divisions are ranged to the south holding the wide 'gap' at Dillsburg. Longstreet has two Divisions in Carlisle (Hood's &amp; McLaw's), while Pickett is still a few miles to the west guarding the ever-lengthening supply line running south to Virginia. Jenkins' coup de main has resulted in the immense Union supply base at Harrisburg being captured almost intact, and every wagon that makes it west over the shallow ford means another day of supplies for the ANVA in the fall and winter to come.<br/><br/>With the Confederates now further to the north, the AoP continues to move forward on the Gettysburg/Hanover/Manchester line it had reached by June 30th. By the evening of July 2nd, Buford's Cavalry is skirmishing with Heth's troops in the Franklintown area. Reynolds has passed Petersburg (York Springs) and is moving forward with the I &amp; XI Corps, with Sickles' III Corps and Merritt's Reserve cavalry Brigade in position to threaten the Mt. Holly Gap a few miles to the west, on the direct route between Gettysburg and Carlisle. Spurred on by the fall of Harrisburg, the rest of the Army of the Potomac is steadily marching north as well, it's concentration greatly aided by the convergence of all the main roads north at Dillsburg. The Union intelligence arm has been working overtime, and General Meade has been handed an opportunity bigger than that which faced McClellan at Frederick nearly a year before. The Confederate Army is stretched over 20 miles, from west of Carlisle to east of the Susquehanna; if he can get the Army of the Potomac through the gap at Dillsburg in force before Lee can concentrate, he will split the ANVA in two with a good chance of cutting the bulk of it off, 100 miles north of the Potomac.<br/><br/>Stuart has continued to bounce off of the right flank of the marching Union Army, and has finally followed Early over York Mountain and back into contact. Lee now knows the true danger of his position, and hurriedly orders Ewell to get his troops back across the river while the rest of the Army rushes to reinforce the troops holding the vital gap. Apprised of the situation, Couch endeavors to maintain contact, using Crawford's veteran troops to slow Ewell's withdrawal as much as possible.<br/><br/>Essentially, this scenario is very similar to the Battle of South Mountain in '62, except that the 'gap' is far wider and less defensible and the stakes, if anything, are even higher! A desperate defense/attack, coupled with wildly variable reinforcements should make for a game with quite a bit of replay value! The Union player must mount a furious attack with his arriving troops, regardless of casualties, knowing that he has a chance to strike a war-winning blow. The Confederate player must form a desperate, collapsing defense on several fronts, while trying to extricate both Ewell's troops and as many supplies as possible from his foothold on the east shore of the Susquehanna.<br/><br/>THE DEVIL'S TO PAY Contains: <br/><br/>    1 full color 22 x 34 tactical map covering the critical gap at Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. <br/>    2 identical 8 1/2 x 11 Op/Maps covering the battle area, as well as the operational area surrounding it. <br/>    1 8 - 12 page booklet detailing the scenario set-up and conditions, as well as a 'historical' article giving the background leading up to the battle. <br/><br/><br/>You must own Summer Storm: The Battle of Gettysburg to play The Devil's to Pay.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

That era saw the Ottomans go from a small nation competing for survival in the Near East to a regional superpower, forming a state that lasted until the end of the First World War. To build their empire, the Ottomans conquered the remnant of the Byzantine Empire, won smashing victories over other Islamic states and twice pushed to the gates of Vienna.<br/><br/>There are four factions in the game, each represented by a color: the Turks (Ottomans and others), the Holy League (mainly Catholic Europeans), the Orthodox (eastern Christians), and the Caliphate (a general term for the more established Islamic states). Within each faction there are individual nations. For example, the Turks include the Ottomans and the Seljuks.   Each player controls a &ldquo;core nationality&rdquo;; that is, one nationality within a faction of which he may never lose control. In the course of the game players may gain control of additional nationalities, some of which may be inimical to each other.<br/><br/>Ottomans is played in a series of turns. Within each game turn, players pick stratagem markers (which allow players to take certain political and military actions), move their forces and engage in combat. A player, while representing an individual faction, may control forces from other factions. Players will find themselves sometimes attacking forces they control, while perhaps temporarily aligning themselves with an opponent, in order to reach their final goals. Throughout each game turn, players may use stratagem markers to gain military and political advantages as well as to undermine their foes. Players receive reinforcements depending on which regions they control.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to build the strongest empire.

12066,Habitants & Highlanders,"['Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Simulation']","['Age of Reason', 'Dice', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame']","Subtitled The Seven Years War in North America, this game covers what those in the USA call the French and Indian War.<br/><br/>The 72-page booklet contains a lot of historical background, discussions of geography, tactics, uniforms, flags, and two different sets of miniatures rules, 11 detailed scenarios (with maps, starting forces setups, terrain, etc.), and a campaign game called &quot;Wolfe and Montcalm.&quot;  The latter includes not only rules, but a page of counters to photocopy and glue to cardstock as well as an 11&quot;x17&quot; map (~A3 size) with point-to-point movement to move the counters on.<br/><br/>One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (each figure = 50 men), and the other Skirmish Scale (1 figure = 1-5 men).  Rules are given for movement, morale, ranged fire, melee combat, Indians, Rangers, European Line troops, local militia, ambush, etc.<br/><br/>Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &quot;3&quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite.<br/><br/>Scenarios include both Battle Scale and Skirmish Scale settings.  Braddock's Defeat, Battle for Lake George, a raid by Rogers' Rangers, Scaling the Heights of Abraham at Quebec City, and many more, are all represented.<br/><br/>The campaign game can be played as a separate wargame, or used to generate Battle Scale miniatures games, as you wish.  Rules are provided for the counters if you don't wish to take the battles to the miniatures table.<br/><br/>All in all, a fine and informative set of rules.<br/><br/>",1992,,,
12067,Little Wars,"['Measurement Movement', 'Simulation']","['Action / Dexterity', 'Book', 'Miniatures', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame']","Little Wars was first published in 1913, but has been published many times since then, including editions from MacMillan publishing and Dover Press.  The rules portion of the book can be read for free online at <a target='_blank' href=""http://www.gardenwargaming.com/wargame/sitemap.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer noopener"">http://www.gardenwargaming.com/wargame/sitemap.html</a>.<br/><br/>The full book includes a fairly extensive history of the game and socio-political discussion of wargaming.  Wells (the famous historian and science fiction writer) was a pacifist, and the book makes for interesting reading, as wargaming was his favorite hobby.  He considered the generals he played with to be reckless buffoons, and was worried for his country should war break out.  (WWI broke out the year after the book was published, and given the massive casualties of WWI, he seems justified in his opinions.)<br/><br/>The rules themselves are fairly simple, as miniatures games go.  There are rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, terrain setup, prisoners, etc.  There are three types of units: cavalry, infantry and artillery.  The toy soldiers of Wells' day were fairly large, so the movement factors are also large, and it's made to be played on a floor.<br/><br/>Ranged combat results are entertaining, but hard to recreate in today's world.  In Wells' time, toy cannons fired little pellets and were actually tooled to be quite accurate.  The game calls for aiming the cannons and firing them, and any figures you knock over are casualties!  The best recreation I've seen was at a convention where we used toy pistols that fired plastic disks: the player had to place the butt of the pistol on the floor next to his artillery and fire from there.<br/><br/>Melee combat does not use a randomizer.  (In the book Wells discusses how he started with a coin flip but was turned against it when one soldier won over twenty battles!)  Instead, compare sizes of units, add in &quot;supporting&quot; units (within a certain distance), and each side takes casualties proportionately.  The remaining smaller force is then taken prisoner and may be escorted to the rear lines - or freed on the way by a rescue attempt.<br/><br/>Although modern miniatures rules are more complex and realistic, this is still a very fun game to play, and is a big hit at conventions.  It's also free online!  It is best played on a floor with one-foot tiles for ease of measurement.<br/><br/>Stand alone expansion of Floor Games<br/><br/>BGG Microbadge -- <br/><br/>",1913,,,
12068,Once Upon a Time in the West Indies,"['Dice Rolling', 'Simulation']","['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Nautical', 'Pirates', 'Wargame']","This game is simply a small booklet, 36 pages.  The players need to supply miniatures, terrain, dice, etc.  This game is strictly for skirmish wargaming, meaning one figure represents one person.<br/><br/>The game contains rules for miniatures gaming with 17th-century swashbuckling pirates and musketeers, as seen in the movies.  Rules are given for movement, ranged combat,  melee combat, morale, etc.  The most interesting rules are the &quot;cinematic&quot; rules, however.  Figures are defined as either Leading Players, Supporting Actors, Bit Parts or Extras.  A Leading Player can mow through a <b>lot</b> of Extras without even slowing down, but combat between two characters of the same level is tense and more drawn out.<br/><br/>Rules are also given for two types of stunts: Deeds of Derring-Do and Dramatic Entrances.  Very entertaining!<br/><br/>The rules not only deal with figures, but also cover ship-to-ship combat and boarding.  The ship movement system is very simple and completely ignores the wind even though these are sailing ships.<br/><br/>Finally, the game provides two scenarios - &quot;Scripts,&quot; they call it, in keeping with their cinematic theme.  One scenario is for pirates and the other for musketeers.<br/><br/>This is a light, easy, not too detailed set of miniatures rules aimed at fun rather than historical accuracy.  It doesn't require a lot of miniatures to get started - even four figures per side makes for an entertaining game.<br/><br/>[Note: there is a companion volume, Once Upon a Time in the West Country, set in the English Civil War.  Similar rules system, somewhat less cinematic.]<br/><br/>",1991,,,

His first book was published in 1962 and the last one I've seen was published in 1998, but there may be later ones, too.<br/><br/>This &quot;game&quot; is only a book - no figures, terrain, dice, etc., are provided.  It contains his rules for skirmish miniatures gaming.  In skirmish wargaming, each figure represents one man (or woman or animal).  Consequently, they tend to represent small action warfare.<br/><br/>The book has a chapter of basic rules common to all the scenarios, then provides detailed scenarios (even with an entertainingly written fictional account) and special rules for the following eras:<br/><br/>The Vikings (850 AD)<br/>English Archers in France (1429)<br/>English Civil War cavalry action (1643)<br/>Pirates in the Caribbean (1715)<br/>The Peninsular War (1813, Napoleonic)<br/>The French Foreign Legion in Mexico (1866)<br/>British Colonials vs Zulus (1879)<br/>The Old West (1888, USA)<br/>First World War trench raid (1916)<br/>Street fighting in Cassino (1944)<br/><br/>A typical battle will feature 8-12 men per side.  Team play is possible.<br/><br/>The basic system requires a player to issue orders to his troops, such as seize a certain objective.  It may take a few turns for the troops to get there, and in the meantime, the situation may have changed.  It takes a full turn to issue new orders, during which the troops continue towards the old objective!<br/><br/>Rules are given for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, wound levels, troop quality levels, morale, etc.  A record sheet is needed to keep track of these things (plus orders), but due to the small number of troops, it's not a problem.  Very fun system if you have access to miniatures and terrain.<br/><br/>Microbadge:<br/><br/><br/>",1975,,,

The individual abilities of ALL the players on the field come into play during the course of a game&quot;.<br/><br/>There are various charts to refer to but the game does flow quickly and because of the nature of the chart information as noted above, it really does make the game come more to life.  I find the game flow with the chart information to move smoothly and does allow for a full statistical game result in a reasonably short period of time.  The player ratings of the &quot;fringe&quot; players is a game design element that really does make this one different and I think makes it a better football sim.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

Each player turns a card over in turn and moves that many spaces - there are overtaking areas and opportunities to block. The car that reaches the finish first is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The advance level allows for more skill to be involved. Each player has their 12 cards and they choose which one to play. Therefore, you can be more tactical by blocking and attempting overtaking moves. You choose the number of laps, whether pit stops should be used etc. Once all players have used their cards, the process begins again.<br/><br/>The board represents Silverstone and the cars are folded cardboard inserted into tabs.

For example, if the going is firm all get 64; if heavy 54. The horses handicap mark is added to however many spaces a player chooses to move their horse per go of a player. So, again, the higher the handicap, the more likely you are to win.<br/><br/>There are times when you will land on a fence and so an appropriate card is drawn and it must be acted upon immediately. There are also horseshoe spaces that can bring good and bad luck.<br/><br/>More than just a dice throw and race game, each player must ensure that each of their horses has enough speed points to go two circuits around the lovely board.

Players of Boxscorepad Baseball are called &quot;owners&quot; to distinguish them from baseball players.<br/><br/>The two owners will watch a baseball game, either on television or in person, or listen to it on the radio.  (You can also check box scores in a newspaper, having chosen players in advance.)  They take turns choosing players from the starting lineups - it doesn't matter which teams their choices are on.  You can have two players from one team and one from the other, for example.  In addition, each owner chooses one player that the other player must take!  No one may take a pitcher.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for various hits, stolen bases, RBIs, and runs scored.  Points are subtracted for errors made.  A tie-breaker is provided, as are rules for three- and four-game series.<br/><br/>",1990,,,

The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the Austrian Empire (modern-day Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic).

12145,The Dice of Wrath,['Dice Rolling'],"['Comic Book / Strip', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Negotiation']","The game comes with short rules, a pad of scoring paper, and five dice.  The dice show the characters from the comic book Knights of the Dinner Table: 1 = B.A., 2 = Bob, 3 = Dave, 4 = Sara, 5 = Brian and 6 = Hoody Hoo!<br/><br/>The theme is RPG characters dividing up treasure after defeating a dragon.  The score sheet lists 11 items, with six &quot;voting&quot; blocks for each item.  Most of the items are positive points; some are worth more to certain characters than to others; one gives negative points and one is neutral, but grants a special ability the second and third round.<br/><br/>Each player takes on one of the roles and has his/her own score sheet.  It's an interesting Yahtzee variant, where you roll the five dice three times on your turn, keeping any faces you want.  You then assign the faces on your own score sheet.  Once a player is done, the next player takes his turn, etc.  When all have gone, start a second round.  The first two rounds are public knowledge: if asked, you must tell how you voted on a given item.  The third round is secret, however.<br/><br/>After three rounds, count up the votes for each character for each item.  There are tie-breaking rules.  High score wins.<br/><br/>During the game you can make deals and break them - this will be no surprise if you've read the comics.  You must record your votes in ink, though!<br/><br/>",2002,,,
12146,Gonnect,"['Enclosure', 'Pattern Building']",['Abstract Strategy'],"From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Gonnect is a strategy board game for two players invented by Jo&atilde;o Pedro Neto in 2000.<br/><br/>The game is played with standard go equipment (though 13x13 boards are often preferred to 19x19) and all the rules of Go apply, except that players can't pass and the pie rule is used to determine who goes first.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to construct a group that connects any two opposite sides. A player can also win if his opponent has no legal moves (since suicides and passes are illegal).<br/><br/>Games between skilled players will end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a &quot;four corners&quot; configuration where neither side can strongly connect. However, since players can't pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has made the smallest amount of territory will presumably get killed first, so building more territory than your opponent is a secondary (but extremely common) means of forcing a connection and the win.<br/><br/>So, a gonnect game between similarly skilled opponents unfolds in two stages:<br/><br/><br/>     The board-filling stage where opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked.<br/>     The eye-filling stage where opponents must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponents. <br/><br/><br/>Although it shares many of the same tactics as go, some players feel that gonnect has a more interesting opening and endgame than Go. Most Go players, however, feel that the eye-filling stage of Gonnect is tedious, and that the game lacks the simple elegance of Go.<br/><br/>",2000,,,

Unlike Go, this placement is compulsory if a move is available; if no move is possible, the game is over.<br/>     No stone may be placed in a location occupied by another stone, or in a location where a stone of your own colour has just been removed. The latter condition keeps the game from entering a neverending loop of stone placement and capture, known in Go as ko.<br/>     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of enemy stones to no longer have any adjacent empty spaces--liberties, as in Go--then those stones are removed. As the above rule states, the opponent may not play in those locations on their following turn.<br/>     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of your own colour to no longer have any liberties, the stones are not suicided, but instead are safe and not removed from play.<br/><br/><br/>Play continues until a player cannot place a stone on their turn. At this point, the number of stones on the board is counted; the winner is the one with the most stones.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/>     Richard PBeM server<br/><br/><br/>",1984,,,

There's also a selection of pinch hitters, one from each category (except pitcher), and a pinch runner.<br/><br/>The player on defense starts the action by rolling a pair of dice; if the total is between 2 and 5, it's a 'hittable' strike (the lower the number, the easier it is to hit); 6 or 8 (except 4-4) are foul strikes; 7 is an unhittable strike; 8 (4-4 only), 9, and 10 are hittable balls; and 11 and 12 are unhittable balls.  If it's a hittable pitch, the offensive player decides whether to swing; if they do, they roll the pair of dice, and consult a chart to determine the results.  Base runners can attempts steals and (sometimes) advancing an extra base on a hit; the defensive player can call pitch-outs if a runner is on base; and the batter can be made to hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, or even suicide squeeze.

Players gain control of the cards by correctly answering curious census questions, then test their skill and luck by determining if the next card is higher or lower than the previous card. Complete with the action-packed Money Round, play Card Sharks and win BIG!&quot;<br/><br/>Based on the classic game show, two players compete to flip over their row of cards by correctly predicting the response to various surveys (one player gives a number, the other guesses &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot;). Whoever wins that question then plays a higher-lower game with their row; players may freeze after a correct card prediction, as a wrong guess removes and replaces all unfrozen cards; the player also loses their turn if the next card is the same as the one before it. Completing the row, or having your opponent fail to do so by the fourth &quot;Sudden Death&quot; question wins the round, and two rounds wins the match.<br/><br/>The winner of the game plays the Money Cards, which offers up to $32,000 in winnings. Unlike most of the late-1980s run, there is no car game.<br/><br/>While using the logo of the 2001 revival, the format is that of the 1970s and 1980s runs. As a result, it does not resemble the 2001 format in any way.<br/><br/>The &quot;Second Edition&quot;, released in 2020, is based on the currently-airing 2019 ABC revival hosted by Joel McHale, and featuring McHale on the box art. The game plays much like the original format, but the front game is shortened to a single 5-question round, with each player having to flip a row of 7 cards (10 in the first season) to win and take $10,000 to the Money Cards, which now also uses a single 7-card line and no money add-ons but can bring the player's winnings to $640,000. And like the revival, the player uses &quot;poker chips&quot; (cardboard markers with poker chip designs) to keep track of their winning s during the Money Cards round.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

In the Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable. His possible courses of action were governed by the &lsquo;technology&rsquo; of the time, the wind, weather, ship&rsquo;s condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships&rsquo; companies.<br/><br/>Fundamental to the rules is the Ability Chart which requires only 1 throw of dice and governs the core game (except Weather) as well as other options. Note:<br/>When for example &lsquo;movement section&rsquo; is referred to in the rules, this relates to the movement section of the Ability Chart.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Taken from the 4th edition (2005), is the description for &quot;Signal Close Action&quot; by Mr. Rod Langton.<br/><br/>&quot;This new edition of Signal Close Action is very timely, this being the year of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.  It inspired me to produce, not just an update of previous editions, but an enhanced game, smoother, with more fluid movement and ability for vessels.<br/><br/>Signal Close Action was designed for sailing navy wargamers who require a set of rules which accurately reflect the era in which they are set.  In Napoleonic period, the difficulties an admiral faced were considerable.  His possible courses of action were governed by the 'technology' of the time, the win, weather, ship's condition, and of course the ability of the admiral himself and that of his captains and ships' companies.<br/><br/>For those who re very new to Napoleonic naval wargaming, you might find my Fast Play set a good introduction.  Even after you progress to a full comprehensive game, your Fast Play will still be very useful for club games and introducing others to the hobby.<br/><br/>Experienced Signal Close Action players will want to know 'what's new' in Fourth Edition.  Well, the concept of the Ability Chart is still fundamental to the rules - particularly as it cuts down on the need for excessive record keeping.  This time however, there are more dice and they play critical roles.  In the past, if you had a 'bad [dice] throw' then ll your actions were affected.  With Fourth Edition, the dice are color coded, with one being 'common' to all.  The score of this Common dice [die] is added to the dice [die] relating to the various actions.<br/><br/>Other new innovations include the division of a player's part of Turn into two segments and reloading, so that the time scale of actions are more realistic.

Jim Dunnigan, then aged 25 and described in the game's &quot;designer's notes&quot; as a history major in the School of General Studies, had already designed 1914 and was at the time working on Origins of World War II, but was asked to take time out to work on this design.<br/><br/>The game is for two players, Radicals and Administration.  The map features eleven tracks for each of the political subgroups in the game (e.g. Black Students, Moderate Strikers, Alumni, Harlem Community).  The objective for the players is to have the most influence, determined by the positions of markers on these tracks, for their side by the end of the twelfth turn.  During a turn, players deploy abstracted units representing their political leverage onto the tracks to 'attack' the other player's units (as tokens, Dunnigan suggests small pieces of paper colored red or marijuana seeds for the Radicals, and blue bits of paper or capsules of Seconal for the Administration) and so move the markers towards their 'end' of the tracks.  The 24 Contingency Cards add some randomness by taking or giving units of wherewithal to one player or another.<br/><br/>SPI sold photocopies of this game supplement for a couple of years after its start.

The game uses a large gameboard, comes in our big box and is for 2-5 players. Playing time is 75+ minutes. It is not a simulation game but provides more Alex flavor than Alexandros. Each turn, players move with their armies (wooden) and build cities and temples (both wooden, too).<br/><br/>In this game, players follow the path of Alexander's army, occupying provinces in regions, building temples, founding cities. You score points each round and also at the end of the game for majorities. There are 5 regions, but for the short game you just use #2 to #4.<br/><br/>Players have 15 tiny wood cubes which they distribute each round on a hidden plan in 4 ways. Then they reveal their choices and carry out the actions. This way they decide 1. turn order 2. army size 3. temple building 4. city building. By putting more cubes than others in the sections controls how the round works for you.<br/><br/>So the player with the most cubes in 1. gets to choose their turn order (since going later may be better). Then the cubes in 2. become your army on the board (and having majorities in provinces scores 2 pts). Moving the armies around costs cubes as well, which are taken from 3. and 4. Then, where your soldiers are, you can build temples (3.) or found cities (4.). But if another player is also doing the same, whoever has the most cubes on their plan gets it, but pays 1 more than the second highest.<br/><br/>In this way, players spend their 15 cubes each round, moving from province to province in the region, trying to score points for controlling armies, building temples and cities. Where players directly compete, the costs are high. Where you are unopposed, your unspent cubes carry on to the next round, allowing you to try to get more points.<br/><br/>When the last region is conquered, there is a final scoring, for the majorities of temples and cities in each region and then in the whole game. The scoring switches here, since in the rounds temples earn you 3pts &amp; cities earn 5pts. But at game end, cities earn 10pts and temples earn 15pts.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of planning, bluff, tactics and group think. It works as a contest of majorities and the use of the cubes, in both deciding who goes and what things cost, is clever.<br/><br/>",2005,,,
12249,Watch Word,['Open Drafting'],"['Action / Dexterity', 'Card Game', 'Word Game']","Players play with a hand of six cards with four community cards loaded into the card-revealing machine.  As the machine rotates, the cards that are loaded spin and are slowly revealed.  When a player thinks that they can use a card that is in the machine, they press the switch in front of them to stop the tower.  They then have to take the card that is in front of them and use it with any number of the six cards in their hand to make a word.  Points are scored based on the number of letters used in the word.  Players play to an arbitrary point total.<br/><br/>Like a number of Ideal games, this game is based around a contraption.

It is 1942, Japan is at the height of her expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific, yet China stands defiantly unconquerable. As the Japanese player, you must carefully pit the Chinese factions against each other while using your superior military machine to bring all of China under your control. As the Nationalist Chinese player, you must cooperate with the Communists (however distasteful that may seem) to drive the invading Japanese from the shores of China before re-establishing your authority as the only central government of China. As the Chinese Communist player, you too are faced with an enemy worse than fellow Chinese. You must first drive the Japanese from China before you can put your superior guerrilla tactics to work against the corrupt Kuomintang.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s Value: This is a simple game with undemanding rules (movement two areas per turn, roll dice in simultaneous rounds of combat, each &ldquo;1&rdquo; is an elimination and each &ldquo;6&rdquo; is a retreat, minor variations on this for leaders, air forces, etc.). It hustles right along at six months per turn, with a variable exit point for the Japanese.

Properties such as Beauty Parlor, Department Store, etc., are bought and sold at prices that rise and fall quite unexpectedly depending on whether the conditions are NORMAL, BOOM times, or BUST (depression times). The game is quick moving and amusing. The game ends when all but one player becomes bankrupt and this surviving player WINS THE GAME. If the players prefer, a time limit may be set at the end of which time the player owning the greatest amount of property and cash (when added together) WINS THE GAME.&quot;<br/><br/>The Board has 16 properties (4/side) with purchase price and rent printed on the inside of each space. The Board has NORMAL prices printed thereon. A removable panel, which fits over two pegs in the center of the board, has BOOM prices and rents on the obverse and BUST prices and rents on the reverse. The game starts in NORMAL cycle, changes to BOOM cycle, then to BUST cycle, then back to NORMAL, etc., when any player lands on any of the three corner spaces marked with a Star. (The fourth corner is &quot;Start Here.&quot;) Players try to increase their worth by buying properties at BUST or NORMAL prices, and selling properties at BOOM prices, while trying to bankrupt their opponents by collecting rents, the highest of which is $250,000. The standard rule concerning landing on Un-owned Property is &quot;buy it or leave it.&quot; There is an AUCTION option in the Rules, similar to the Auction Rule in Monopoly.<br/>This game plays like a simplified version of its more famous stable mate, Monopoly, but with the unique twist that all properties' values increase or decrease at the same time, sometimes in rapid succession, without having to develop the properties or have groups or sets.<br/><br/>The raised playing field (Board) actually sits in the 15&quot;x15&quot;x2&quot; box bottom (it is not designed to stand alone). It has a slot on the outside of each property space, wherein the owner places his/her like-colored &quot;T-card&quot; vertically to show ownership. The bills, which are the size of older Monopoly games, come in denominations of $100, $1000, and $10,000. There are also blue/white discs worth $5,000 and silver/blue discs worth $50,000.

The partnership making the high bid may be challenged by the others, who can potentially double or treble their score, but can re-challenge (&quot;fight to the finish&quot;) for quadruple points (all of these have large negative consequences if one loses).<br/><br/>The trick play is more or less standard, with two exceptions.  One is the pair of unsuited trumps, which rank below the top four cards of the trump suit.  The other is that the five suits are grouped into a pair and a triplet, and the suits in each set can be played for each other at times (the rules are a bit confusing here).<br/><br/>Scoring is reminiscent of bridge, with points earned above and below the line.<br/><br/>While the main game is for exactly four players, a solitaire game is included.<br/><br/>Probably the main point of interest is the game's 1930s Socialist flavor.  The good suits are Scientists, Idealists, and Judges, with the bad ones Bankers and Advertisers.  The cards are individually named, some for people and some for methods and tools (&quot;Radio,&quot; &quot;Logic,&quot; etc.).  The unsuited trumps are Honesty and Kindness.<br/><br/>Also of interest are the card illustrations.  Some were done by the designer, but the others by well-known American artists of the period - Rockwell Kent, Peggy Bacon, William Gropper, and George Schreiber (other cards were by Esther Vance, who appears to not have attracted much attention in the art world).

12308,Towers in Time,['Hand Management'],"['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy']","From the box:<br/>In the beginning those that could master going between dimensions thought of it as novelty. There were worlds to discover, creatures to see and most importantly magic to master. But with all these things to keep them busy there was one thing they did not forget, Power. Soon it was easier to take from others than to find it on your own. The only place to hide was in great magical towers that they built between dimensions. All times in your world and in the others are at your disposal.<br/><br/>Will you be the last to Reign in Towers in Time?<br/><br/>Play overview:<br/>Each player represents a spellcaster, dueling with the other players for control of an abstractly defined extradimensional space.  Each player has five shields, represented by cards from that player's deck, that serve to anchor the player the dimension within the game's story, and as the player's presence in the game mechanically.  The goal is to eliminate the shields of all other players; when a player has no shields remaining, they are banished from the pocket dimension, and out of the game.  Victory goes to the last player with shields in play.<br/><br/>To combat one another, players play Source cards, representing connections to various natural locations, be they landforms, weather phenomena, or natural disasters.  These resource cards allow the player to access Temper, the main resource in Towers in Time, themed to the four elements.  Using Temper, players pay the costs to summon creatures to wage war, conjure magical objects and artifacts to enhance the effectiveness of recruited creatures, and cast spells to strengthen their minions and weaken the opposing armies.  Additionally, once creatures are in play, most of them can provide Temper as well, although typically less than Source cards; most cards in Towers in Time are resource generators in addition to their other game effects.<br/><br/>Source cards serve as the base for the titular Towers of Towers in Time.  Each Source has a default file of three ranks atop it, each space of which can be occupied by creatures and the cards they carry.  Creatures enter play within Towers, and must match the element represented by the Source atop which it stands (except for Neutral creatures, which may be played into any Tower).  There are rules to determine which creatures can enter play in which locations within a Tower, but once in play, most creatures can move between Towers, taking attached cards with them when they move.<br/><br/>Turns do not follow the turn format common to many contemporary CCGs.  Instead, several phases are completed simultaneously by all players, then players alternate initiating and resolving a single action until both players have passed.  Action resolution varies depending on their effect, with some actions initiating a separate resolution phase with its own actions and timing (such as combat) and others are single-step actions (such as playing a card).  Additionally, a number of supplemental actions (&quot;free&quot; actions) facilitate utility functions, such as drawing Temper to pay for spells.  The opportunity to act first during the action round is determined by the player who won initiative during game setup (for the first turn only), or the player who did not take the last pass action on the previous turn.<br/><br/>",1994,,,

These riches are represented in the game by shiny gold counters which look very much like wide, flat gold bars. Only gold returned to one's port counts for victory.<br/><br/>The sailing ship's hulls are printed on cardboard sheets, to be punched out and folded into shape. Three wooden dowel masts are inserted through punched-out, printed paper sails and then through the decks of the ships.<br/><br/>The board is a blank diagonal grid of 32 square ocean spaces with the four players' home ports in the corners. The 29 Sea Square tiles are shuffled and 32 of them placed face down on the spaces. There are four each of Island, Reef, Ship and Monster tiles plus the Cipangu tile, a Fog tile, and a Storm tile. All others are open sea.<br/><br/>There are four Encounter Decks, cards from which are drawn when a ship discovers Islands, Reefs, Ships, and Monsters. The monsters are the only fantasy element of the game. Their artwork is drawn in the style of the &quot;Here There Be Monsters&quot; of the old mapmakers. Each deck has cards with good or bad results: gold bars, extra sailors, repairs, attacks by monsters or pirates, grounding on reefs, being attacked or helped by island natives, etc.<br/><br/>Each ship starts with three sailors and three masts. The markers for the sailors are actually the familiar plastic push-pins available in any dollar store, without the pin. Both sailors and masts serve as 'hit-point' indicators: any ship that loses all masts or all sailors is sunk. Movement range is determined by current no. of masts to a maximum of 3 spaces.<br/><br/>There is a wind direction spinner which is a 'top' made up of an octagonal direction card with a wood dowel through the center. This is spun to determine which direction a player's ship cannot sail that turn.<br/><br/>Players move around the board, turning over the sea tiles and trying to accumulate gold and survive the various events that can damage their ship. When the one Cipangu tile is discovered, players can get 3 gold bars each turn they stay there.<br/><br/>Players can also 'Turn Pirate' by attacking another player's ship or port. 1d6's are rolled and compared, low roller in each round loses one sailor, ties cause both ships to lose a mast. Ships that lose all sailors are plundered of their gold and sunk. Ships that lose all masts just sink.<br/>  Combat against ports is handled the same way except ports have no masts. Players can leave extra sailors in port as defense forces. Sunk ships are replaced, and damaged ships repaired, by paying one gold bar and continuing with a new/fixed 3-mast, 3-sailor ship from your port.<br/><br/>Once the last Sea Tile is turned over, the game ends and Gold Bars are counted up to determine a victor.<br/><br/>",1979,,,

Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation.

The 18 Greatest Holes publsihed in the 1962 edition contain 4 different holes than later versions of the 18 Greatest Holes.<br/><br/>As the Golfer card sets ran out of production APBA publshed new sets to replace the out of production sets.   This led to the creation of a:<br/><br/>1962/64 set, 1972, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and an All Time Greats Set.   Sports Game Publishing and the APBA Journal also published a number of golf sets in later years as well.<br/><br/>8 Courses were published by APBA officially (Two Versions of the 18 Greatest Holes).   The now defunct Sports Game Publishing company also published at least 3 more courses for the game adding: Sawgrass, Winged Foot, St. Andrews and Oakmont to the list.  The format for these course were 3 to a page on 11 x 17 paper and then changed to 8 1/2 x 11 with one course per page.<br/><br/>ASG Golf (George Gerney | <a target='_blank' href=""http://www.asggames.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer noopener"">www.asggames.com</a>) has gone on to publish courses for: Bethpage Black, Pinehurst No 2., Augusta National, Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, St. Andrews, TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill.<br/><br/>From the APBA Journal: An Eighth APBA Golf Course (For Holes 3,4,5,6 of the greatest hits)<br/><br/>&quot;While preparing the Golf Archives Reference Pack (now available from the AJ office). I encountered a letter to the editor in the August 15, 1971, issue of APBA Innings. (Back in those practically prehistoric days, the AJ covered only baseball, leaving APBA's other sports to its competition, AI.)<br/><br/>The letter, by Doug Bauer, notes that the original APBA golf course, the 18 Greatest Holes compilation, had changed between the game's original appearance in the mid-1960's and 1971.<br/><br/>In the original course, holes 3,4,5 and 6 all came from courses in Southem California. Number three was the fourth hole at Riviera Country Club, Los Angeles. a par three. Number four was the eighth hole from Lakeside Golf Course in Hollywood, a par four. APBA's fifth hole was the third at Vaney Club in Santa Barbara, a par four. And number six was the 14th at Los Angeles' Bel Air Country Club, a par five.<br/><br/>In the later version, number three is the 13th hole at Congressional Country Club in Washington, D.C., a par four. APBA's fourth hole is the 14th at Brookline (Mass.) Country Club, a par five. Number five is the eighth hole at Westchester Country Club, Harrison, N. Y., a par four. And number six is the third hole at Akron's Firestone Country Club, also a par four.<br/><br/>As a consequence of these changes, par is 71 in the later course but just 70 in the original version.<br/><br/>So it turns out that there are, In effect, eight APBA golf courses rather than the seven we knew about:Augusta (1964), Merion (1975), Pebble Beach (1976), Firestone (1976), Pinehurst (1977), Pine Valley (1977) and two versions of the 18 Great Holes (1964 and c.1970).&quot;<br/><br/>Sports Game Publishing was a company that published expansions for APBA products, they maintained a web presense from 2002 thru 2006.

Recently Dr. Cline started from scratch and carefully dissected the game with a mathematical precision not possible when the game was developed. The result is a game completely compatible with the golf courses and cards you currently own, while allowing you to play a modern golf bag and manage holes the way today&rsquo;s pros do.<br/><br/>Golfers will drive the ball, hit fairways, and putt the way they do in real life. You can finally choose from the clubs the players really carry; no more 2-wood that today&rsquo;s players never use. Instead, choose a 4-wood, 5-wood, and/or 1-iron&mdash;just like the pros of today! If you have always wanted wind, course conditions, lie conditions, and each golfer&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;work the ball&rdquo; to have the same influence on your course that they have in the real game, now they can!<br/><br/>Dr. Cline&rsquo;s new Master Game elements are individually implemented, so you can add some of them, all of them, or none at all, and still achieve a level of golf accuracy never before possible. Combined with charts that finally are capable of reproducing the abilities of golfers of the 21st century, this fantastic new game will allow you to use the golf courses and golf cards you already own with accurate results, while integrating future cards and courses as well.<br/><br/>The new &ldquo;boards&rdquo; are actually a spiral-bound, 8&frac12; x 11-inch booklet, printed on card stock for durability, that contains complete playing instructions and play charts for both the Basic and Master games. The game box also includes all the components you need to play: dice, shaker, ball markers, and score sheets designed for use with both the Basic and Master games, along with nine sample golfers and a sample golf hole.<br/><br/>APBA has announced that they plan on re-publishing APBA Golf in 2010.<br/><br/>",1962,,,

Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With geomorphic board tiles, exquisite plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and introducing a rich set of strategic dimensions that allows each player to refocus their game-plan, the original designer (Christian T. Petersen) has seamlessly incorporated the better qualities of other recently popular games to improve on the game-play of the original TI, making it at once perfectly well-rounded and pleasantly familiar to experienced gamers.<br/><br/>TI3 is played by at least three players who belong to ten possible alien races, each with their own advantages and quirks. The 'designer notes' in the rulebook candidly and humbly acknowledge the inspiration for some of the improvements to the original game. The strategic game-play borrows the governing element from Puerto Rico to involve players in an iteratively complex and yet fast-paced game experience with very little downtime. The game map, basic player progress and overall victory are dynamically determined in almost exactly the same way as they are by imaginative players of CATAN, while the &quot;Command&quot; system cleverly improves on the 'oil' logistical mechanism of Attack! to both manage turn-based activity and limit the size of armies, uniquely enabling weakened players to bounce back if they play their cards right.<br/><br/>Part of the Twilight Imperium Series.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Second Edition<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition – Shattered Empire<br/>    Twilight Imperium: Third Edition – Shards of the Throne<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented in:<br/><br/>    Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition<br/><br/><br/>",2005,,,

After a day long fight at Mons, the British fell back in a delaying action, eventually making a stand at Le Cateau.

The French chief commander, Field Marshal Joffre, decided to make a stand south of the Marne River. The German, changing their initial Schlieffen Plan, attacked through the gap between Paris and the Allied left wing, further to the east. Their intent was to destroy the Allied armies in one grand battle of annihilation. But the plan went awry. The Germans had outrun their lines of communication, and it was difficult for them to replace their losses while the Allies, with their ever shortening lines of communication, quickly regained strength. At the critical moment, the French Paris Garrison counterattacked on the extended German right flank. The resulting conflagration caused the German to pull back.

I'm not certain where to begin describing this one, so let me give an overview and a look at the components.<br/><br/>The game board is styled after the traditional Monopoly board as a square with properties down each of the sides and special areas on the corners--in this case the corners are *J.C. Nichols Parkway* Start &gt;, Tax Audit &laquo;Pay&raquo;, &deg;Stock Market: Collect&deg;, and *Uninsurable Loss*.  Unlike the traditional Monopoly board, there are no squares that are not properties (e.g. no Chance, Community Chest) Additionally, the properties are not grouped in colors.  All of the properties are representative of Plaza businesses at the time of printing.<br/><br/>The six player pieces are small, colored, enameled, metal, horse-drawn carriages, like the type that they use for carriage rides down on The Plaza.

The cardboard insert inside the box has no markings on it, there is nothing on the inside of the lid, and the box itself is completely blank and made to look like a nice leather briefcase (albeit made of cardboard) and has no information on it, not even the game's name--the name only appears on the board.

There are 8 different colours, and each colour is assigned a value from 1 to 8. The number printed on the central hexagon is the sum of the values of the three coloured hexagons on that tile (e.g. a blue-blue-red tile would have a value of 11 as blue = 4 and red = 3).<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The tiles are shuffled and each player is randomly dealt 7 tiles, which he/she puts in front of him/herself face up. The remaining tiles form the draw pile. Players take turns adding one of their tiles to previously laid tiles. Tiles always have to match in two colours, and the new tile has to be laid so that it touches only the edges of the previously laid tile. Players must not fit tiles into each other, there must always be a hexagonal gap between two tiles. A player who cannot add a matching tile continues to draw tiles from the draw pile and adds them to his/her tiles until he/she finds a matching one.<br/><br/>A round ends when a player has gotten rid of all his/her tiles. Each of the other players sums up the point values of their remaining tiles and scores are written down.

A random scenario card defines the objective of the game. There are open scenarions where each group knows what's at stake; and hidden scenarios, where only one party knows the objective, but the other group has to stop them.<br/><br/>Depending on the scenario, there are some devices available: Cars that increase movement (but can't enter buildings or parks); barricades that block roads or access to buildings; and explosives that can be used to block spaces or remove barricades. There are also chance cards that either call a random event, or represent an utility that can be kept for later use.<br/><br/>The two groups act in alternating order. Three dice are rolled for movement points that are assigned to pawns (the decision is made as group).

Six yellow tokens&mdash;numbered 1 to 6&mdash;are shuffled and placed face-down on the black circles in the middle of the board. All but the middle one are then covered with caps.<br/><br/> Object:  Players try to collect the numbered tokens of their own color and to assemble them into the highest possible number (i.e., 4321). As the first token is collected, it the must be placed on the ones column, the second on the tens, the third on the hundreds, and the last on the thousands column.<br/><br/> Play:  Chose a start player and play clockwise. The active player takes one cap of his choice and places it over the one yellow token that lies free (for the first player, this will be the one in the middle of the board). The number token just freed is turned face up (if not already face-up). The number on it determines how many spaces the player moves his pawn. If he lands on a yellow space, he repeats the procedure (i.e., transfer a cap, reveal a number, move pawn). If he does not land on a yellow space, his turn ends and it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, a player who remembers which number is under which cap may plan his moves accordingly. He cannot, however, use the same movement number in two successive moves because the cap must always be placed on the free token. If a player lands on a yellow space three times in succession, he reshuffles the yellow tokens, places them face down, and covers them as was done at the start of the game.<br/><br/> Winning:  The first player to complete a 4-digit number wins and ends the game. If additional rounds are played, a running tally should be kept of each player&rsquo;s numbers, which are totaled at the end of the game.

There are two kinds of UWO; The Gnorfs and the Pnorfs. Both of them are able to morf. But that is something that will be explained later on. The Gnorfs think that the Pnorfs are a group of ugly creatures and that feeling is completely mutual. All the more reason for them to start a war!<br/><br/>beginning of the game<br/>UWO is a cardgame and a boardgame at the same time. Both players have six energy cards. The playing field is formed by the energy cards of both players. One player places them horizontally, directly in front of him. The other player does this at the side vertically, just like on the photo. The playing field is between these energy cards. <br/>Both players place their ten 'regular' UWO's of their own color in front of them in two rows of five each. The players shuffle their pack of cards and place them both upside down in front of them.<br/><br/>energy<br/>Just like life on our planet, life on Znorf is expensive too. Everything you do will cost you &quot;Energy&quot;. you have to pay it for morfing, walking or fighting. Strong UWO's use much energy. If both players used all of their six energy, then a round is over. Everyone gets back his energy. But beware! If you're out of energy and your opponent isn't yet, he will play several turns at once! And for your opponent, weak (and cheap) UWO's come in handy now. They can do a lot of damage to you!<br/><br/>many different UWO's<br/>There are no less than eight different UWO's in the game. Some are riding Knorfs (strange animails). They can trample everyone. Others are cowards, hiding in bunkers, etc.<br/>UWO's carry many different weapons. Lasers, dynamite, granades, bazooka's, etc. The bazooka UWO for instance, is one of the coolest of the gang and he himself thinks so too. He is extremely powerful. He can even blow up tanks! Unfortunately, such a bazooka is a great danger to our tiny UWO. Each time he has shot someone, he will be knocked out until the end of your next turn!<br/>UWO's are specialists. Every UWO has protection against a specific other UWO. For instance, a UWO in a tank has protection against one who fights with his bare hands.<br/><br/>dynamite UWO<br/>Well, let's just say there's only one of it on each side. One who can be quite important to both players...<br/><br/>morfing<br/>UWO's can morf in exchange for one energy point: UWO cards may be placed on UWO's that are already in the game. This way, a regular UWO can be morfed into anything you want to, just like that! This can be very useful. Imagine a laser UWO threatening you. Your opponent announces that it's going to attack!! Don't panic, his UWO can never hit you when you are hiding in a bunker! So, when you have this card, just morf your furry alien into one and shoot back...and hope your opponent doesn't morf his UWO into a grenade UWO...<br/><br/>the pack of cards<br/>At the end of each turn each player may refill his/her cards to 3. But beware, players can run out of cards. The game still goes on untill all UWO's of one player in the battlefield are destroyed. It is very easy for an opponent to adapt his army to yours, when you are not able to morf anymore! Imagine your opponent creating a small army of laser UWO's to attack your last bazooka UWO! They have protection against this weapon. You may panic now, cause your lost.<br/>In the pack of cards, there are also nine &quot;miss cards.&quot; When you play this card, the shot will automatically be declared &quot;missed&quot; and of course you will have the chance to shoot back with this UWO. But don't play these cards to fast! Smart opponents remember how many you have left. When you lost them all, your opponent knows that every shot will be a hit.

12681,Neuland,"['Action Points', 'Tile Placement', 'Turn Order: Time Track', 'Worker Placement']","['Civilization', 'Economic']","Neuland is a game about logistics and planning.  In the beginning of the game, the land lies undeveloped, a series of blank hexes representing mountains, forests, and grasslands.  Players win by building and using prestige properties that allow them to place their family's coat-of-arms onto the board -- first to place all their coats of arms wins.<br/><br/>To use these buildings, though, requires the player have the correct raw materials.  Swords and cloth, for example, or coins and paper.   Each one of these materials needs even more basic materials, such as iron ore, coal, and so on backward toward the most basic elements such as food, wood, and stone.<br/><br/>To cull these materials from the land, one builds buildings -- a Stonecutter's Hut, Smelter, Coin Manufactury, and so on.  Once on the board, buildings can be used by any player, not just the one who built them.<br/><br/>A player doesn't collect these resources for safekeeping as in The Settlers of Catan or Keythedral.  Instead, resources claimed via buildings must be used up either in the player's current turn or his next one.  If he doesn't, the resources spoil and are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Essentially, the challenge of the game is one of planning logistical supply chains which will allow one to process these resources most efficiently to build the prestige properties the fastest.  Since it's a perfect information game, one can also see what one's opponents are scheming, and place workers to interrupt their supply chains, possibly causing their resources to spoil and making the player start from zero again.<br/><br/>Neuland's most interesting innovation is perhaps its Time Track Mechanism, in which players who take less actions in a turn will have turns more frequently, and can forward-plan in order to take a long turn of nearly twenty actions instead of the ordinary maximum of ten.<br/><br/>Neuland was originally published by eggertspiele in 2004, and republished by Z-man in 2006 with some significant rules changes.

It is a chess variant with the board expanded to 12 x 12 squares. Follow-up variants in the next two issues of Command added a some interesting variant pieces with new moves and powers and a whole different chess-like game based on 20th Century military units, none of which got the attention it deserved because of the outrage and bad feeling left over from the initial impression. For chess players some interesting ideas, many of which have been seen before in one form or another. For historical board wargamers, it was simply not enough there, and it seemed like a rather pathetic and transparent attempt to cover up XTR's failure to have a suitable alternative to the planned issue game.<br/><br/>EDIT REQUEST:  Does anyone have any information about the game itself?  How it plays, how it differs in strategy and &quot;feel&quot; from regular chess?  Any information other than how it came to be published?<br/><br/>And from the images, it appears the board is 16x16, rather than 12x12.<br/><br/>",1998,,,

Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice&mdash;just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.<br/><br/>In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.<br/><br/>Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!<br/><br/>",2005,,,

It already has one supplement released - &quot;Freeplay '88&quot;, dealing with a NATO exercise in 1988.<br/><br/>The game has been compared to &quot;Harpoon 4&quot;, perhaps unfairly, as while it covers the same topic (modern naval warfare), the aim is present a much more global scope.  Command of small fleets of ships is very easy in this game, as weapon effectiveness is determined by a single value and weapon damage is a single value (heavy, medium, light, etc).<br/><br/>Ship damage are represented by a damage area with 4 damage levels - two 'lights', a 'heavy', and a 'critical' damage level.  When a weapon damages a ship, a d10 is rolled and the weapon's size is compared against the size of the target ship on a chart to see the resulting damage level (with a chance of 'none' being one of the levels).  If the given damage level is already called for, the next level up is used.  The net effect is as mirrored by hypothetical naval combat - ships take very few hits to be 'mission killed'.<br/><br/>Detection is handled within the rules in a very basic way, although special note should be made of the submarine rules.  They make use of 'range bands' around a target ship.  Submarines are not placed on the 'board' unless detected, making their approach and attack on these 'range band' diagrams, essentially their exact position unknown to BOTH players - neatly avoiding the need for a third player as referee almost always required in other games of the type.<br/><br/>The production values of the game are fairly high - no counters or maps are included, but, given the nature of most modern naval games to use miniatures or simply graph paper, that's certainly forgivable.  The game manual itself is printed on glossy paper with plenty of images throughout (several pages include color images) that really set the mood for the game.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

It includes scenarios for WWI, WWII, Angola, Vietnam, and the Boxer Rebellion. The scale is 1:1 skirmish.<br/><br/>Arc of Fire (AoF) is intended for games employing forces up to company level, with from one squad to three platoons on each side using 10mm-28mm miniatures, often with armor or artillery support. One of the prime design goals of AoF was to find a level of detail that was fun and easy, but still captured the flavor of skirmish gaming. If rifle magazine capacities, tanks&rsquo; power-to-weight ratios, or the quantity of high explosive in particular shells are the type of factors you really want in a game, you should probably not be looking at this book. The basic assumption of AoF is that leadership, training, organization and motivation are more important than minor technological advantages in deciding who wins. By concentrating on these rather than on &lsquo;kit&rsquo;, AoF produces a fast and exciting game that is more realistic than many games that obsess about technical detail.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    The Face of Battle: The Hill Battles – Khe Sanh, Vietnam: 1967<br/><br/><br/>",2002,,,

Like Mousetrap, the gameboard is dominated (in fact, consists of) a large Rube Goldberg-ish contraption.  Players use a plastic &quot;putter&quot; to flick a small (about 1cm in diameter) ball around a nine-hole miniature golf course.  Some holes require the ball to roll into an elevator which carries it up and dumps it into a spiral track leading to the hole.  Others require the ball to be hit up a ramp into a basketball hoop or rebounded off bumpers.  One hole even consists of a dangling plastic chicken that swings back and forth pendulum-style (a little oil might be useful for this one as there's too much friction as-is for the chicken to swing freely.)  Players have three chances to play each hole.  Whoever sinks their putt in the fewest shots is awarded a token--no tokens awarded for ties.  The ninth hole has two holes, one harder to reach than the other.  Players are awarded one token for sinking their putt into the easy hole, or two for the hard one.  The player with the most tokens wins.<br/><br/>",1994,,,

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/>Aldo Pasetti self-produced the game and was sued by the publisher of Scrabble, that has very, very similar board, tiles and rules. The trial took place in the late '50s and ended with a verdict of acquittal on the basis that game mechanics are not relevant and no confusion can be made between a long name as &quot;Scarabeo&quot; and a short one as &quot;Scrabble&quot;, so it is not even unfair competition.

Play  progresses in a series of alternating stock and operating rounds. During stock rounds, players may purchase and sell stock in corporations.  During operating rounds, the corporations lay track, place railway stations (tokens), run trains for revenue to be withheld or paid out, and purchase trains. The player who owns the most stock in a given corporation makes all decisions for said corporation during an operating round.<br/><br/>The game is notable for the small size of the board compared to many 18xx games, and its innovative game end: The climax of play sees the beginnings of railway nationalization in the United Kingdom, with the weakest companies being eliminated from private operation earlier than those which are the healthiest.<br/><br/>Other notable differences from most 18xx games include:<br/>-Players may own up to 100% of a corporation, and may sell presidents&rsquo; certificates into the bank pool, at which time a corporation goes into receivership and continues to operate.<br/>-Corporations are never required to own trains, and thus player bankruptcy is impossible.  Instead, a trainless corporation becomes insolvent and leases a train based on the current phase, withholding all earnings. <br/>-Corporations are allowed to run one train through one &ldquo;tokened out&rdquo; city once per operating  round, which makes strategic route building and station placement key.<br/><br/>The game was initially produced in a small print run of c.100 copies.  JKLM and Z-Man games released a larger, but still limited, 2nd edition (with an alternate map) in 2010.

It is a 3D Chess game that is played on three 8x12 boards stacked above each other. The top board represents the air and features pieces like the Griffon and the Dragon. The middle board represents the land and has pieces like the Oliphant, the Thief, and (of course) the King. The bottom board represents the underworld and contains pieces like the Dwarf and the Elemental.<br/><br/>Like regular chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's King. Many pieces move like their chess counterparts, but many others have unconventional moves taken from other chess variants that are further complicated by the game's three dimensional nature.<br/><br/>For example, on the upper board, a Sylph piece moves like a Berolina pawn. It may make a non-capturing move one space diagonally forward, or it may capture by moving directly forward one space. It may also capture by moving straight down to the middle board. While on the middle board, the Sylph cannot move at all except to make a non-capturing move back to the top board. It may move to the square directly above it OR any empty one of the six home squares that any friendly Sylph occupied at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",1985,,,

Whoever gets 10 points first wins the game, even if all of the players have not had a turn.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to score &quot;Carabinas.&quot; If you roll any Carabina during the game you immediately win the round and get to keep rolling for another round.<br/><br/>There are three types of Carabina, listed in order of value.<br/><br/>Carabina de Aces -- is worth ten points and is very difficult to obtain. To get Carabina de Aces, you need to get a complete set of five aces within the three-roll limit. If you get Carabina de Aces, you are awarded 10 points. The game is over. You have eliminated everyone else in the game. You are the winner of the game, even if no one else had a chance to roll! If you get Carabina de Aces, then you are always the first roller in the next game.<br/><br/>Carabina de Ks (Kings) Naturales -- you need to have five Kings within your three allotted rolls. If you get this type of Carabina, you get five points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.<br/><br/>Carabina de Ks (Kings) No Naturales -- the only way to obtain this is by pairing the Aces with the Kings. (The Ace can be paired with any of the other dice because it is wild.) If you obtain this type of carabina, you get two points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.<br/><br/>If nobody gets a Carabina after everyone has had their turn, one point is awarded to the person with the highest hand:<br/><br/>&middot; Five Queens<br/>&middot; Five Jevas (Jacks)<br/>&middot; Five Gallegos<br/>&middot; Five Negros<br/><br/>The strategy in Cubilete is knowing what to play for and when, depending on what your opponents score.

The game does not include Asia. It is strictly a series of naval and island hopping maneuvering and battles fought in the Pacific. We always wanted to play with the boats more in A&amp;A, but we also wanted to win. The boats and planes are so expensive that no one can really afford to wage much sea war after the first turn or two in A&amp;A. Enter Conquest of the Pacific. Both sides face daunting tasks. Japan has a huge fleet, but has a lot of islands it needs to conquer to win, and ends up being so far away from its supply lines that it usually can't defend everything while still being able to challenge the growing American fleet. America starts the war far from a state of readiness, but its huge economic advantage helps make up for it. The front is close to the US, so supply lines are short, but the Japanese fleet is usually much larger if it can consolidate. This makes for some interesting cat and mouse maneuvering and epic sea battles.<br/><br/>Planes take a large role in Conquest of the Pacific as they are able to:<br/><br/>1. land and take off from islands without it costing a movement point because the island and the sea zone(s) surrounding/adjacent to the island are considered the same zone.<br/><br/>2. project their defensive power one sea zone away from their island base zone during the opponent's combat phase.<br/><br/>3. defensively scramble to attack anything entering their zones of projected power during the opponent's turn on the combat movement and non-combat movement phases.<br/><br/>4. escort other units to protect them from defensive scramblers.<br/><br/>Battleships and Destroyers may bombard every round during an invasion, or once per turn without a land invasion.

12839,Operation Barbarossa,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling']","['Wargame', 'World War II']","Up to 4 people can play, one controlling each German army group (North, Center, and South), and one playing Russia. Russia gets 5 factories to place in the cities of their choosing at the beginning of the game. Each produces a specific unit type (2 infantry, 1 armor, 1 fighter, 1 bomber). Germany can't see anything in Russian cities. Russia keeps its units and factories hidden from view on a city card. When Russian troops move out of cities, they are moved from the city card to the main board.<br/><br/>Railroads connect many of the Russian cities, which they can use to non-combat troops from city to city hidden from German view. Germany may try to cut the rails to limit Russian movement. Germany may scout Russian cities with a bomber to try and find out what is there, however, you can't scout and attack on the same army group's turn. Therefore, one army group must scout, and the next in the turn sequence can attack.<br/><br/>The German players must work closely together in this game. German troops may be transferred from one army group to another, and are then controlled by that new groups player. Because of the hidden units, it is a game of high tension on both sides. Most of the time Germany isn't really sure what Russia has in a city it is about to attack. And, most of the time, Russia has nowhere near enough troops to defend everything they need to defend. There is a lot of cat and mouse, educated guessing, and downright devious strategy (&quot;Hum, he would expect me to do this, so I'll do that. But he might be counting on me taking the less obvious choice...&quot;<br/><br/>The goal is for Germany to take Moscow, but to do this, they almost always need to take out the Russian factories which are producing units closer to the front. To make matters worse, Russia can dismantle, and move each of their factories once to another city. So, just when you think you have it all figured out... We're usually nervous wrecks by the end of a game...and usually ready to start another one right away!<br/><br/>",2000,,,

Since only a complete understanding of scoring will allow a player to make good plays, however, it may be a little hard (while reading these rules) to understand when, where and maybe even why a player would place a cards into play. For now, suffice it to say that cards placed next to each other are potentially worth points if the icons on their adjacent sides match up in either shape, number or color. Sometimes a player will want to aim for matches worth maximum points. Other times he may want to form &quot;connections&quot; worth no points at all, in hopes of stopping his opponent from scoring. All the while a player has to keep a close eye on what his opponent is up to!<br/><br/>As far as the design goes, Synapse is my attempt at a real-time game that has no luck and no room for cheating during the fast play. I think it succeeds well on these two accounts.&quot;<br/><br/>",2004,,,

This means that two pattern-pieces can move near each other, and then portions of each of the original pieces can be moved away together as a different piece, leaving behind the remainder of the original formations, which can, in turn, be used as other pieces.<br/><br/>If a piece moves in such a way that it overlaps one or more stones (of either player), all stones that the piece moves onto are captured.<br/><br/>Each player must maintain one piece that is a ring of eight stones around an empty square at all times.  If one player is in a position where he no longer has such a ring anywhere on the board for any reason, he loses.<br/><br/>",1994,,,

However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces, if they wish.<br/><br/>In fact, World War II in the East can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.<br/><br/>With World War II in the East, you fight major carrier engagements, have air battles over Guadalcanal, conduct landing operations on the many island chains of the Pacific, outflank and surround forces in Burma, as Japan transport resources from Southeast Asia and the East Indies, and manage the industrial output of your nation.<br/><br/>World War II in the East includes over 900 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Australian, New Zealander, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known American fighter squadron that fought with China against the Japanese.<br/><br/>The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 47 by 36 inches. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 300km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.<br/><br/>The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from December 1941 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Scenarios allowing you to play shorter scenarios will be posted on the publisher's website as they become available.<br/><br/>World War II in the East&rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional counter wargames as it&rsquo;s complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>World War II in the East can be combined with World War II in the West to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors.  Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.<br/><br/>The first versions of the game supported up to five players, but the German 2011 edition supports up to seven (simply by increasing the number of chips).<br/><br/>This game was originally published in Germany in 2004 by Amigo as Geschenkt ...ist noch zu teuer!, meaning Even given as a gift, it is still too expensive!.  Amigo's 2006 international edition, titled No Merci! (a delightful multi-lingual pun), had rules in several languages, including English.

Greatly outnumbered, the Greeks delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Led by the Spartan King, Leonidas, a small force of 300 Spartans and 11,000 other allied Greeks blocked the only road through which the mighty army of the Persian King, Xerxes, could pass on its ongoing invasion of Greece. The massive Persian army, numbering well over 150,000 men succeeded in defeating the Greeks but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the Greeks. A local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks, revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers to delay the advance of the Persian army as long as it could.<br/><br/>In the Battle of Thermopylae 2nd Edition board game is a 2 player board game where the two players must bid to see which player will control the smaller Greek forces.

13004,The Downfall of Pompeii,"['Events', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Move Through Deck', 'Square Grid', 'Take That', 'Tile Placement']",['Ancient'],"The year is AD 79. Pompeii, sitting at the foot of Vesuvius, is at the high point in its development. People come to the city from far and wide to try to make their luck in the city. So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?<br/><br/>The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.<br/><br/>The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.<br/><br/>After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

(&quot;Dance of the Horned Oxen&quot;) challenges players to place their ibexes/cows on the game board without being pushed over the edge.<br/><br/>Players start with a random assortment of numbered tiles in hand. The game board depicts multiple rows that will hold tiles, with the rows being of varying lengths and with symbols in some spaces. Draw four tiles at random, and place one in the leftmost space of each of the first four rows.<br/><br/>Each round, each player selects and reveals a tile at the same time. Tiles are placed on the board in order, from lowest to highest, and which row a tile is placed in is determined according to these rules:<br/><br/><br/>    Lowest number: If the played tile's number is lower than that of the end tile of all four rows, place this tile at the end of the row with the highest number.<br/>    Increasing number value: The number on the tile must be higher than the number on the tile that is currently the last tile in that row, but...<br/>    Smallest difference: The tile must be placed at the end of the row where there will be the smallest difference between it and the tile currently at the end of that row. All four active rows must be examined to determine which has the smallest difference.<br/><br/><br/>When a player places a tile on a negative space/cowpie, they score that many points, moving their pawn that many spaces on the score track. (If any of the active rows has an uncovered &quot;Happy Cow&quot; space, the player loses points instead of gaining them.)<br/><br/>When a player places a tile on the final space at the end of a row, that row is completed, and the player must execute the following actions in order:<br/><br/><br/>    Score penalty points as shown on the final space by moving their pawn on the score track.<br/>    Move the just-played tile to the first space of the next unoccupied row.<br/>    Remove the remaining tiles from the completed row. Choose one or two to keep behind their player screen, then place the remaining tiles in the box or off to the side as they will not be used for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/><br/>At the start of a round, players can purchase 1-3 random tiles from the supply at a cost of 1 point per tile. (If someone plays their final tile in a round, they immediately draw six tiles for free.) A player can have at most nine tiles on hand. If a double play space is uncovered in an active row, then players must play and reveal two tiles. Twice during the game, when a player passes a specified point on the score track, in the next round players reveal their tile choices face up in order from fewest points to most points.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the end of the score track or no tiles remain to be purchased, finish the round, then the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

It's described as a game like Poker with unusual twists.<br/><br/>There are the same numerical cards, 2-10, Jack (Knight), Queen, King and Ace. And like in some Poker varients the Ace may be played as high or low. Whereas a standard Poker deck has four suites, Swords &amp; Dragons has eight. And there is a similarity in which one hand will defeat another.<br/><br/>The game play appears to be a mix of Hold 'Em, Stud Poker and Go Fish. Cards can be asked for and received by another player if one hasn't hidden them in their Trove. The Trove allows a player to hold up to four cards without worry of them being asked for in Go Fish style. Essentially players can use the cards in their hand and the one &quot;Up&quot; card, that being the last card discarded, as their current hand. The &quot;Up&quot; card may also be taken by a player on their turn and the discard becomes the new &quot;Up&quot; card.<br/><br/>A round ends when all but one player folds - due to not calling a raise, or the deck runs out of cards.. or, all players call the raise. Then a showdown occurs and it's winner take all.<br/><br/>The components are a bit flimsy.

Capturing four pawns allows two pawns to move three spaces each, and your sixth pawn captured lets you move all three pawns up to three spaces.  Once you've captured eight pawns, one may move up to four spaces, and so on.<br/><br/>The game is basically following the arrows and moving around the paths trying to capture opponents.

Each tile is effectively a 3x3 grid with each square being colored black or white.  All possible 3x3 grid patterns are represented, with the number of tiles for each pattern being the number of distinct rotational positions it has.  Each tile has patterns on both sides, with each being the inverse coloring of the other.<br/><br/>A number of different ways to play are provided.  There is a solitaire puzzle in which you try to fit a given number of pieces together so that the color patterns on the edges always match.  There is a two-player game using the provided 16x16 board in which each player takes a color and tries to create a continuous path of that color across the board.  A number of variants are provided for this game. Finally, there is a multi-player game (no upper limit on players is specified, but six seemed reasonable) in which players are trying to get rid of tiles by playing them to a common 3x3 array.  Unplayable tiles must be used to form a personal 3x3 array.  All the games use the same edge-matching rule as the puzzle.<br/><br/>",1988,,,

It never made it past the prototype stage.<br/><br/>Each side drafts a team simply by writing seven numbers on a sheet of paper and assigns them positions (1 Center, 3 Forwards and 3 Guards), then choosing 5 of these to start the game. Players position and move their team members up and down the board for the best chance to make a shot (or cover a rebound), then roll on charts when a shot is taken to determine the result. Movement (both distance and the ability to change directions) is determined by the position played by each team member. Players can also challenge possession as the ball is dribbled or passed.<br/><br/>Each quarter progresses until both teams combined have scored at least 15 points, though experienced players can boost this to 25-30 per period. After 4 quarters, the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, 7 point overtime periods are played until a winner emerges.<br/><br/>It is uncertain how many prototypes 3M produced. Reputedly the prototype(s) were of production quality, save that the inner black box was not specifically tailored to the game.<br/><br/>At least one prototype was sent to Sid Sackson for evaluation, with a note from 3M asking for his opinions and stating that he could keep the game. Sid later apparently sold this prototype, but made photocopies of the rules and key game elements in 1993 and retained these for reference.<br/><br/>",0,,,

The first game in this new series is Alexander the Great, a game that covers the career of the fabled King of Macedon, from his ascension to the throne until his army has &quot;Hellenized&quot; half the known world.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great uses an interesting new system that gives the players a feel for the era and the problems of campaigning therein. For one, there are no turns. Play keeps going until the Macedonian Player wins or Alexander dies. And winning, for the Macedonian Player, is no mean feat. Yes, his armies are mighty, but Alexander is a game in which the player must not just win battles, but also overcome the logistics of campaigning &hellip; building armies, getting them to where they're needed, understanding battle fatigue and weariness, dealing with personalities, and adapting to the society you are trying to seize.<br/><br/>The player's goals, as Alexander, are multiple and difficult. To win, he must maintain his hegemony of Greece, become Great King and establish his Deity. The latter two require him to achieve eight separate, often difficult objectives, including controlling key provinces, building Alexandria, gaining control of the Royal Family, and invoking proskynesis (homage by prostration). A clever Persian player has many ways to stop the Macedonian from earning these, and the money and manpower to help him. Given Alexander's &quot;greatness,&quot; play testers found the game to be remarkably balanced.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great uses cards, but it is not a game &quot;driven&quot; by cards - this is not a Paths of Glory system game. Rather, it uses them to provide the players with the historical opportunities and outside events that shaped Alexander's campaigns. The cards cover such events as Alexander's drinking problems, the shadowy figure of Bagoas, the friendly presence of Black Cleitus, and possibilities of assassination, mass marriages, Spartan revolts &hellip; even a Honeymoon for the weary Macedonians!<br/><br/>Combat uses a fun, two-tiered battle resolution system that accounts for many more factors than just numbers, and often leaves armies- even winning armies- in far worse shape than you may want.<br/><br/>The Conquerors: Alexander the Great is a game rich in historical detail, a game that places major burdens on the players to achieve victory, and a game that's great fun!

13236,Der Schwarze Prinz,['Hand Management'],['Abstract Strategy'],"Der Schwarze Prinzor &quot;The Black Prince&quot;<br/><br/>This is an abstract conflict game along the lines of chess, with high production values for its time, in which 2 players aim to capture the central piece of the opponent's army. The rules stress that is based on the first major land battle of the Hundred Years' War, the 1345 Battle of Cr&eacute;cy, but only if you ignore factors as terrain, the tactics of the time, the fact that the French had twice as many troops, the decisive deployment of the longbow by the Welsh and English archers, and that there was only one Black Prince (on the English side). And that it actually took place in 1346, on August 26.<br/><br/>So, stripped of any historical constraints, both Field Commanders now oversee 2 identical armies, consisting of 4 different soldier classes, each with different movement options, but also, like chess, of equal capturing strength. Besides armies on the board, both players always have 3 special cards which are the main engine behind the thrust of the game.<br/><br/>Whether an attack is successful or not doesn't depend on the attacking piece, but if the attack card, that gets played with each attack, can be stopped by a suitable counter card held by the defender. Since players always have a hand-size of three cards, the battles are not decided by clever maneuvering and the interaction of different pawn abilities, but simply by the luck of the draw. Nothing will save you if you have the wrong cards.<br/><br/>Combining a chess-like game with card play was a nice idea, but unfortunately the way it was implemented simply reduced the board game element to a mere sideshow, and put luck firmly at the center of each victory.<br/><br/>Publication history: one of Johann R&uuml;ttinger's earliest games, and when it appeared by Noris Spiele in 1983 it even became his second nomination for Spiel des Jahres in two years, after &quot;Vokabo&quot; made the shortlist in 1982.<br/><br/>",1983,,,

The game spawned the &quot;Great Battles of the American Civil War&quot; series and is a direct descendant of the old SPI favorite, Terrible Swift Sword: Battle of Gettysburg Game.<br/><br/>Components include three newly revised and beautiful maps by Mark Simonitch and Joe Youst (building on older work by Rick Barber and Joe Youst), 1680 counters including units and markers, some new charts, and ver. 4.5 of the GBACW rules.<br/><br/>This edition attempts to bring a simplification to the complicated LOS procedures of the previous editions.  The counters have also been cleaned up and overall this edition has quite a bit of visual appeal.  This game is very complex but is a great simulation of ACW tactics.  However, the game also works with a slimmed down version of the GBACW system rules called &quot;Simple Great Battles of the ACW,&quot; the release of which coincided with the publishing of the game.  SGBACW brings the series to players who are do not have the inclination or time to master the relatively formidable GBACW ruleset.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Each deck of Age of Heroes will be a full set of collectible cards which can be used to play a solitaire or multi-player card game.<br/><br/>The cards are divided into Heroes, Treasure and Monsters. Treasure is broken into Weapons and Armor and Spells and Items. Players receive a party of heroes and attempt to defeat the monsters, gaining treasure each time you defeat a monster. The game is essentially solitaire; you score based on how many defense points of monsters you beat divided by how many heroes you lost.

13268,1864: Year of Decision,"['Point to Point Movement', 'Simulation']","['American Civil War', 'Wargame']","1864 was truly the year of decision in the War of Secession. While the North needed only one more year to break the South's back and end the rebellion, at the time the military situation did not appear to be so promising. After three years of war the Union had not subdued much of the rebellious South. The Union held enclaves along the coast, all of Tennessee and some other scattered holdings, and it controlled the Mississippi River. However, the bulk of Southern territory, especially the deep South, was untouched. The principal Southern armies in Georgia and Virginia were as strong as ever. The South had shown its ability to wage war in spite of military reverses and blockade.<br/><br/>1864 - Year of Decision is a board game simulation of the decisive campaigns that brought the American Civil War to its violent conclusion. Players assume the roles of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis and their senior military advisors. Players operate armies, corps and divisions in military regions that reflect the maneuver limitations experienced by the belligerents. The combat units are rated for troop quality, leaders' tactical abilities, leaders' initiative and command span. The game compels players to focus on the interrelationship between military operations and their political consequences. Victory is determined by political points resulting from military successes and failures.<br/><br/>Each game turn of 1864 - Year of Decision represents five days of the campaign. Move your playing pieces representing Union and Confederate corps and headquarters from region to region accurately recreating maneuver during the Civil War. Each region consists of two districts. Assign missions to your forces by placing the units in the Attack or Defend box in each district. Units which Defend in a district can improve their defensive positions. Send your cavalry forces on raids against enemy targets. Attack to defeat your opponent's forces and capture key objectives. Headquarters can lead attacks or individual corps can attempt to attack on their own. A die roll determines if each unit succeeds in at-tacking. Resolve combat based on the sizes of the attacking and defending forces, the quality of the troops involved, the tactical rating of the commanders, supply and morale conditions, defensive positions and weather. Battle will yield casualties and prisoner losses on each side and may force a withdrawal by the loser.<br/><br/>Trace supply for your forces along rail lines to supply depots or, for the Union, to an occupied port. Units can operate away from their supply lines for short periods, but need to re-establish supply after combat. Break rail lines or devastate regions on the map to cut enemy supply. Both sides also face monthly losses due to attrition. Several optional rules allow players to increase the game's realism. Five scenarios allow players to recreate the struggle in either theater from two different starting points or to play the entire campaign.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>        Rules of Play Booklet in our easy-to-read bullet paragraph format<br/>        Player Reference Booklet with notes on the historical situation and the game's design<br/>        280 Die-Cut Playing Pieces<br/>        2 Mapsheets featuring the Eastern and Western Theaters<br/>        2 Small Mapsheets covering the approaches to Savannah and Mobile<br/>        11 Color Play Aid Cards<br/>        1 Die<br/><br/><br/>(description from Omega website)<br/><br/>",2001,,,

Lee&rsquo;s summer offenses (1862 &amp; 1863) at the corps/division level using hidden deployment of units and dummy counters and one week turns.  Confederate forces must go on the attack to win while the Union army struggles to protect Washington, DC and Baltimore.  The map is very basic and players each have about 20 units each to control, creating a game that focuses on Civil War-era strategy rather than details and chrome.<br/><br/>Confederate units are divisions while Union units are corps and cavalry are represented by brigades.  Rules cover dummies units, cavalry probes and screens, forced marches, rail movement, and leadership and command issues while the units take losses by steps.  Although not visually appealing, &ldquo;Lee Moves North&rdquo; is a playable and subtle game of two Civil War campaigns at the operational level.<br/><br/><br/>Uses a system similar to SPI's The Wilderness Campaign: Lee vs. Grant, 1864.<br/><br/>",1972,,,

Each suit has cards numbered 1-6, four copies of each.  There are also four Inspection cards, one for each player, and a Warmonger card.  The Swords and Warmonger are distributed at the start of each hand - whoever gets the Warmonger card plays differently from everyone else.  Peaceful players disarm (discard face-down) Swords cards and build sets of Plowshares, Manpower, and Cogwheels, while the Warmonger secretly &quot;disarms&quot; Plowshares and other non-Swords cards and builds using Swords instead of Plowshares.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for building sets and for successfully deducing who the Warmonger is (the Warmonger gets points if no one figures this out).<br/><br/>",1963,,,

13290,Byzantium Reborn,"['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers']","['Political', 'Wargame', 'World War I']","From the MicroDesign Group Website.<br/><br/>THE GREAT IDEA<br/><br/>World War I (1914-1918) left both Greece and T&uuml;rkey near ruin. By 1920, Greece was emerging from what amounted to a civil war between supporters and opponents of the visionary but reckless prime minister, Elefth&eacute;rios Veniz&eacute;los. T&uuml;rkey's civil war was still in progress, fought between the last, heartbroken Ottoman Sultan and the dynamic new insurgent, Mustapha Kemal (later called Atat&uuml;rk).<br/><br/>Each side in the wider struggle pursued its own vision of national rebirth. For Veniz&eacute;los and Greece the dream was called &quot;The Great Idea&quot; and promised the renaissance of Greece as a great power through a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, the reconquest of Constantinople (lost to the T&uuml;rks in 1453) and the reunion of all ethnic Greeks under the rule of Athens. For Kemal's T&uuml;rks, their own &quot;great idea&quot; was the forging of a new, compact T&uuml;rkish Republic united not by the outdated creed of Islam but by a new T&uuml;rkish nationalism, modernized and empowered by Western culture and commerce.<br/><br/>These two visions of national rebirth fought bitterly over the plains, deserts, and mountains of Anatolia for three long years. Western Anatolia was ethnically mixed, and neither side had an exclusive claim. The great prize was Smyrna, taken by Greece in 1919: a city which was home to more Greeks than Athens itself. The war had profound implications for the entire region. Greek victory would cement Greece as a regional power, and act as a beacon of hope to Orthodox Russians seeking to topple Lenin's Communists in the ongoing Russian Civil War. T&uuml;rkish defeat would mean the collapse of Kemal's vision of a secular, democratic T&uuml;rkey and would block the spread of Western values in the Near East, leaving T&uuml;rkey battered and backward, and the rest of the Moslem world feeling victimized and enraged.<br/><br/>As it happened, T&uuml;rkey won and Greece lost. Kemal's vision prevailed; T&uuml;rkey emerged victorious, united and profoundly westernized. Women gave up the veil and went to school. The Roman alphabet replaced the Arabic, and Islam was evicted from politics. For the Greeks, the end came in September of 1922 when the T&uuml;rks captured Smyrna and burned the city to the ground. A million and a half Greeks fled or were expelled, and nearly 2,900 years of Hellenic civilization in Asia came to an abrupt and humiliating end. Greece, overwhelmed by refugees, collapsed into a series of coups and revolutions punctuated by all sorts of autocracy and spectacular misrule, from which, arguably, it has only recently recovered.<br/><br/>Whose &quot;great idea&quot; will shape the modern Near East? Now you can make the decision by playing Byzantium Reborn!<br/><br/>Byzantium Reborn is a simulation game on the Greek-T&uuml;rkish War of 1920-22. The game is for two players, one representing the Kingdom of Greece and its allies (the Greek player), and the other the insurgent nationalist forces of Mustapha Kemal who opposed the Greek invasion (the T&uuml;rkish player). The 11 x 17&quot; map of Anatolia (Asia Minor) depicts the areas where the war took place. The scale is about 40 miles to the inch. The 280 counters represent the military formations including Turks, Greeks, French, Italians and many others.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

13301,Caraïbes,"['Action Queue', 'Area Movement', 'Auction/Bidding', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Simultaneous Action Selection']","['Bluffing', 'Nautical', 'Pirates']","Description of the game play from co-designer Michail Antonow:<br/><br/>The board shows the Caribbean in the 18th century. Six pirate ships lie in wait on sea, ready to pillage the rich ports or to rob the booty from other ships.<br/><br/>The sea is divided into spaces. Each player is in possession of three safe havens, marked in his color on the board. If only two or three players are playing, the safe havens in the vacant color(s) are treated as normal sea spaces.<br/><br/>The aim of each player is to lure the pirates to deliver treasure crates to one of their own safe havens, and not to the safe havens of the opponents.<br/><br/>The pirate ships do not belong to any player. That is why the players must bribe the pirates each time they want a pirate ship to act on their behalf. And what is the greatest temptation for a Caribbean pirate? Rum of course, barrels full of rum!<br/><br/>In every round the players try anew their best to bribe the pirates. The player who has offered the most rum to a ship gets to move that ship as many spaces as the number of barrels shown on the bribing chip. An active ship can (a) rob a crate from a port or from another ship, (b) reach a crate over to another ship, (c) swap crates with another ship, and/or (d) deliver a crate into a safe haven.<br/><br/>The aim is to have the most doubloons at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Normally, each player controls one ship, but experienced players should be able to fly three or four ships without too much difficulty.<br/><br/>Astromachia is distinguished from other games in this genre by three features: fast, highly interactive play; realistic Newtonian movement; and a strong sense of three-dimensionality.<br/><br/>Players alternate taking very simple actions, such as maneuvering, angling shields, or firing a weapon. This prevents long waits for a chance to do something.<br/><br/>Movement follows Newton's laws of motion. A ship doesn't always move in the direction it is facing. Furthermore, if a ship gets going too fast in one direction, it has to turn around and fire its engines to slow down.<br/><br/>Astromachia is fully three-dimensional. Ships can fly at different altitudes, and can move up or down as easily as moving north, south, east, or west. (These directions are with reference to the local star system, not to a planet.) A ship can have any of 24 different orientations, and is damaged differently depending on whether the damage is coming from the fore, aft, port, starboard, dorsal, or ventral side.<br/><br/>",1997,,,

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.<br/><br/>The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the falls, it's a hefty investment to replace it.

With more men and material landing each day, the growing power of the American and British forces should have resulted in a drive inland -- but three weeks after the landings, the shallow beachhead had only expanded slightly. There was growing concern that the bloody fighting of the First World War might be repeated.<br/><br/>British forces should have captured the city of Caen, just 15 kilometers from Gold Beach, on the first or second day of the invasion. British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, commanding 21st Army Group, faced great pressure to secure the city and tie down German mobile forces while the Americans captured the port of Cherbourg. But a direct attack on the city itself failed at the cost of many Canadian and British lives.<br/><br/>Next the British attacked west of Caen, where a successful advance might outflank the city and force a German retreat: Operation EPSOM, an attempt to gain by maneuver what could not be taken by assault. British divisions, fresh to war but having trained for years, faced the feared SS troopers of four panzer divisions. Both would soon learn the harsh realities of war in the hedgerows and fields of Normandy.<br/><br/>Although Montgomery in the end did not force the Germans to abandon Caen itself, he did draw the German armor onto the British Army, who both tied it up and ground it down. The whole purpose of sending I and II SS Panzer Corps to Normandy was to drive the Allies into the sea. Steady British efforts forced the commitment of the armored formations as they arrived on the field and so depleted them that no coordinated German offensive was ever launched.<br/><br/>Beyond Normandy is a Panzer Grenadier game covering the British operations from the end of June to the middle of July and the German reactions to them. Three maps (two 22&quot; x 34&quot; and one 22&quot; x 17&quot;) depict the actual battlefield at 200 meters a hex and include individual bridges, villages, tracks, roads, hedgerows and church steeples.<br/><br/>The 583 playing pieces represent leaders, infantry and tank platoons and artillery batteries. They include the weapons employed by British infantry and armored brigades and German SS and Wehrmacht panzer and infantry divisions. New British tank types include the Churchill, Cromwell and Firefly tanks, the flame-throwing Crocodile, and the bomb-throwing AVRE. The Germans bring tough SS grenadiers, Panther tanks and more.<br/><br/>The game includes 39 scenarios and 5 &quot;super&quot; scenarios (combining two or more of the scenarios into a large-scale operational scenario).<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Once all first shots have been played, the player furthest from the hole plays. When two players are the same distance, the player arriving first plays.

Whether it matches or not will determine what happens next (water, sand trap, out of control, make it to the green, etc)<br/>     If in a sand trap &mdash; roll 2 dice (and/or play a card).

The number of the card played to make it to the green determines the distance to the hole. Roll dice to see if you putt into the hole.<br/>     If the number cannot be found - You have a lost ball. Count 2 penalty strokes and roll dice again. (Note: A number is missing on each hole.

13333,Dead Hand Chaos Poker,['Betting and Bluffing'],['Card Game'],"The Dead Hand Chaos Poker deck adds a twist on traditional poker. Play virtually any poker game you can think of (7-card stud, 5-card draw, etc). At the end of a hand, if there are still two or more players left for the showdown, the top card from the draw pile is turned face-up. 60% of the cards have a hidden message on the face of the card. By tipping the card back and forth in the light, a particular card or hand will be revealed in the varnish of the card. The named card or hand (if any) is dead and out of play.<br/><br/>For instance, if the King of Spades is flipped up, the hand with the low spade is dead. If a seven is flipped, all Wild cards are dead.<br/><br/>Even with its unique twist, Dead Hand is primarily a straight-forward game of Poker. The Dead Hand mechanic ends up only effecting approximately 20% of the hands played. So don't use the mechanic as a crutch, you've still got to play good poker.<br/><br/>That said, you may find that the added element of chance keeps people in the game longer and folding a bit less than they might otherwise. A reference card is included, so you can watch which cards have been played and have a better idea of which hands are more likely to be killed by the Dead Hand.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

It is based on a study of 36 major land battles fought between 490 BC and 42 BC which are provided as scenarios. Battles are fought out over a small hex grid, with terrain overlaid terrain tiles and single-hex unit counters. Size of armies is usually around 10-12 units. There are no dice involved in combat resolution, so the battle is decided entirely by the tactical skill of the players in deploying and maneuvering their units (thus the likeness to Chess).<br/><br/>Phalanx was published in issue 165 of Slingshot, the Society of Ancients journal (back issues on CD are available to members).<br/><br/>",1993,,,

13337,Bid Whist,"['Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']",['Card Game'],"Whist is a trick taking standard deck playing card game that was played widely in the 18th and 19th centuries and is often mentioned in literature from that time period.<br/><br/>The most basic version of the game features fixed partnerships with no bidding. The game uses a single deck, and follows the basic mechanics of most trick taking games: the starting player leads a suit, and then the other players are forced to follow unless they have none of that suit left, in which case they are allowed to either toss a useless card of another suit, or to play a trump.<br/><br/>The object of Whist is to acquire tricks in excess of 6, each 1 of which scores 1 point. In this basic form the game usually goes to 5, though 7 and 9 point variations were also common. The trumps in standard Whist were determined by facing the last card to be dealt.<br/><br/>In addition, like most card games, there are a large variety of variants. A common one involves pre-determing the trump suit, and running them in order from hand to hand. (For instance: Hearts first, then Diamonds, Spades, and finally Clubs, and then start over again)<br/><br/>Another, less popular and luck oriented variant involves giving a 4 point bonus to a partnership if it held the 'Honours' run of A - K - Q - J in the suit that was trump for that hand or 2 points if it had 3 of the 4. As this is based on the cards as dealt it is a very luck based option, and as such has fallen out of common use though it was once considered a standard way to play the game.<br/><br/>Other variants include bidding (quite common, and turn the game into something closely resembling Spades) and two player adaptations.<br/><br/>",1663,,,

Quality sets comprise wooden trays inlaid with the special scoring cards (King Hearts, Queen Spades, Jack Clubs, ten diamonds and the greatest scoring seven of diamonds), plus a conventional 52 card pack and betting tokens (poker chips). Cheaper sets are invariably plastic and can be found in most French supermarkets for a few Euros/dollars.  The objective is to dispose of the cards in your hand, playing them in simple numerical sequence from 1 (Ace) to King, picking up bonuses along the way. The suits have no significance other than when playing the five special cards. The person playing the King terminates the sequence and may restart it with a card of their choice. This is where the strategy comes in. Remembering which cards have been played allows you to frustrate your opponents by starting a sequence favoring the cards remaining in your hand.

If it is a 1 you can place a chip on it, close the stack as you found it then break it somewhere (like a deck of cards, pick up half, place down, and put bottom half on top).<br/><br/>If, when you open the stack, you find a disc with your chip on it, you can break it a second time. If the second break reveals a disc 1 higher than the one your chip is on, you can move it. So, if you split the stack and find you chip on a 1 disc, you can split it again and if you find a 2 disc move the chip from the 1 to the 2. Either way you close the stack as you found it again and only if you moved a chip, break it somewhere again (to confuse others). If you reveal a disc on your first break which has your chip on a 3 you can remove it from the stack.<br/><br/>In this way you move chips from 1 to 2 to 3. Always trying to remember which discs you've seen and which you have not, and what's on them - in face of every successful player breaking the stack quickly and nimbly.<br/><br/>",1976,,,

This grid affects movement and combat - doing away with tedious millimeter measurements and allows the player to focus on maneuvering his units and rolling the dice. Squares can be either open (no impediment to movement) or closed (terrain impedes movement).<br/><br/>Troops are organized into units, and graded according to type (close order foot, open order foot, close order mounted, etc), quality (elite, veteran, trained, levy), and armor. The basic system is for units roll a number of dice (number determined by the abilities of the unit) to hit, and defenders roll dice to save the hits (if they have armor). Each unit may have up to four &quot;hit points&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are published in a 36 page binder, and contains army lists for Sumer to the Mognols. In addition to the usual rules for terrain, movement, and combat, C&amp;K distinguishes itself by adding rules for the &quot;setting&quot; of the battle, by including pre-battle effects such as seizing key features on the battlefield prior to the battle, ambushes, and losing troops prior to the battle for various reasons.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors. Here we assume he chose instead to reorganize the mobile divisions of Panzer Groups 2 and 3 and ad hoc Panzer Army Guderian, putting that general in charge of a daring effort to take Moscow, thereby winning the war by plunging the entire Soviet Union into strategic paralysis.<br/><br/>This is a two-player, operational-level, alternative history wargame of low complexity. In it, the German player controls all Panzer Army Guderian units and is opposed by the Soviet player who controls all the Red Army units.<br/><br/>The situation is inescapably such that the German player controls the strategic initiative and sets the overall tempo of play.

13399,The Planet Management Game,"['Cooperative Game', 'Simulation']","['Economic', 'Educational', 'Environmental', 'Science Fiction']","The Planet Management Game&trade;<br/><br/>Players have a high paying job with University Planet Management Associates. This team has been given the task of managing the planet Clarion for the next 50 years. Note that a Clarion year is much shorter than our own.<br/><br/>A brief history of Clarion (from the game manual)<br/><br/>The plant Clarion is much like the Earth in size, climate, and geography. However, the land area is smaller than the Earth&rsquo;s. The living things on the planet are similar to plants and animals on Earth with one exception &ndash; there is no native animal like man.<br/>      About 10 years ago the Council of Civilized Planets transported 100,000 colonists to Clarion from the planet Rasmuss. These colonists are similar to people, but are smaller. They have shorter life spans than people and look a little different, too. You could call them &ldquo;humanoids.&rdquo; Their food is similar to ours.<br/>      The natural state of Clarion is like Earth&rsquo;s before man began to change it. Some of the land is flat and has a mild climate that is good for farming. There are some deserts of purple sand. They are fiery hot during the day and cold at night. There are other regions of bare rock that separate the fertile areas. All the land is on one continent. The rest of the planet is a blue-green ocean much less salty than Earth&rsquo;s.<br/>      There seems to be only one major threat to life on Clarion &ndash; the disease Holobinkitis. It attacks both plants and animals, Clarionmen included. No one knows the cause of the disease or a cure for it. It is almost always fatal if you catch it.<br/>      Clarion has one large and unusual mineral deposit. The mineral is Walterite ore. In fact, Clarion is the only known planet with such large deposits. Several scientists say that the metal obtained from the ore is superior to iron or steel for most uses. However, Walterite is usually found under a thick layer of hard rock. Thus, it is often difficult to mine.<br/>      In comparison to Earth, Clarion has a low standard of living. The Clarionmen don&rsquo;t produce all the things need and want. As a result, they are thrifty. They don&rsquo;t like to spend money unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. Then they want to get a &ldquo;good deal: for every bit of money they spend.<br/>      They have some of the same problems the Pilgrims had when they first settled in North America. Food sometimes becomes scarce, and it is expensive to import food from other planets. One of the big problems with raising crops is that the insects on Clarion really like to eat them. Therefore, a large part of every crop is lost to insects.<br/>      Most of the Clarionmen say they will stay on in spite of the hardships. They believe Clarion has a bright future once things get going. The Clarionmen usually give three reasons for leaving their home planet of Rasmuss:<br/>      1: It was getting too crowded there.<br/>      2. There was a promise of a better life on Clarion.<br/>      3, Clarion is a beautiful place to live.<br/>Most Clarionmen have a strong appreciation for beauty, and they enjoy nature. They look forward to more leisure time outdoors.<br/><br/>End quote from game manual<br/><br/>As manager of Clarion, the players will keep track of four variables: population, income, food, and environment. They are given a budget of 10 bux (a Clarion buc is equivalent to about one million U.S. dollars) to fund planetary project for the next five years. Each budget will determine which projects Clarion will fund for the following five years. In the course of the complete game ten 5-year budgets will be prepared.<br/><br/>On turn one Clarion&rsquo;s population index is at 100, each unit representing 1000 Clarion citizens. The income index and the food index also start at 100. When the population index equals income index, citizens have enough money to buy basic necessities. If income exceeds population, Clarion citizen&rsquo;s standard of living will have improved. When the population index equals the food index there is enough food to provide each citizen with a well-balanced but simple diet. If food index falls below the population index, citizens are going hungry, perhaps even starving.<br/><br/>When humans first landed on Clarion, the environment index was 100. The air was pure, the oceans and river clean, the land beautiful. In the first years of colonizing Clarion, the environment index has decreased to 90. The population would like the environment restored so that environment index is at least as high as the population index. However, they would also like the income and food indices to increase relative to the population index as well.<br/><br/>For each budget, players have 10 bux to spend on projects. There are five different groups of projects that may be funded: red, blue, orange, yellow, and green. Each group (or color) contains three projects, only one of which may be funded. Each funded project may be funded for 2, 4, or 6 bux. Of course any group with no funded projects costs no bux.<br/><br/>Red (Agricultural Improvement projects)<br/>1) Clear more land and prepare it for raising crops.<br/>2) Import chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br/>3) Buy machinery to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops.<br/><br/>Blue (Scientific Research projects)<br/>1) Conduct research to develop new varieties of corn, wheat, and rice with higher yields per acre.<br/>2) Conduct research to identify the cause and cure of Holobinkitis.<br/>3) Conduct research to find better ways to mine and use Walterite.<br/><br/>Orange (Industrial Expansion projects)<br/>1) Build more Walterite mines and purification plants.<br/>2) Build more highways and railroads to connect towns.<br/>3) Construct new electric power plants.<br/><br/>Orange (Public Education projects)<br/>1) Build more schools for all age groups and for general, professional, and technical education,<br/>2) Pay people to go to graduate schools of civil engineering, biochemistry, medicine, and agriculture.<br/>3) Finance the Einstein Plan: a) send a few of the most capable individuals to Earth for advanced study, and b) connect more Clarion homes to the educational television network.<br/><br/>Green (Industrial &amp; Residential Pollution Control projects)<br/>1) Construct more and improved treatment plants for city and factory waste.<br/>2) Finance the Wright Plan: a) buy areas of land around lakes and oceans to be used for recreation, b) build mile-high apartment buildings surrounded by 100 acre parks in the center of cities.<br/>3) Equip more chimneys of homes, industries, and other buildings with antismoke equipment.<br/><br/>The mechanics of playing this game:<br/>A major part of this game is the 50 8&frac12; x 11&rdquo; cards. These cards have a variety of small holes punched in them similar to early IBM punch cards. Each of the 15 possible projects has 3 cards: a 2 bux, a 4 bux, and a 6 bux card. And in case no project for a given color is funded, there is also a zero bux card for each of the five colors. To make their budget, the players select one card of each of five colors not to exceed their 10 bux limit. When the players have chosen their five cards, the five cards are stacked together revealing one (and only one) hole that is open in all of them.<br/><br/>The game also includes a data book. This book contains data pages for Population Change, Income Change, Food Change, and Environment Change for the different rounds of the game. For the first round of the game, the players turn to the &ldquo;Rounds 1 &amp; 2&rdquo; pages, where they are presented with four different population change pages.<br/><br/>It is almost quaint to realize that this game was made in the days before Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the ready availability of four sided dice.

Each player has a ball pin to indicate their locations on a hole. A deck of cards is used to indicate the results of a swing.<br/><br/>On a turn a player calls out the club he is using, choosing from a (very 1920s) selection of: Driver, Brassie, Midiron, Mashie, Mashie-Niblick, Niblick, Putter. The player then turns over the top card, consults the club he called, and moves his pin down the fairway the amount of yards indicated. Some cards indicate a poor swing by declaring the ball out of bounds or in the rough. A ball landing in a hazard has a limited club selection for its next shot. For example, a ball in the rough can only be played with a Mashie, a Mashie-Niblick, or a Niblick. When a player's yardage generated equals the yardage of the hole, he has holed out.<br/><br/>Since this is an old game that was published before stroke play became the standard, the winner is the player who won the most holes (match play).<br/><br/>",1928,,,

Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Prince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.<br/><br/>Created in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;<br/><br/>",2006,,,

An American flag is placed on every eighth Star (there were only 48 states at the time), while Red Tokens are placed on the remaining Stars.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player spins the spinner and moves his playing piece the number of Stars indicated. He then reads aloud the name of the State he landed on, the year it was admitted to the Union, and (without looking at the map) the State's Capital. If he names the Capital correctly he may keep the Flag or Token. If the player is incorrect he moves backwards to the first vacant space. If he spins a &quot;1776&quot; or a &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; he moves forward to the next space with a flag or token and, if he correctly names the Capital, may spin again.

It is not your typical game expansion, but is a completely new game, with several new rules, and potentially new strategies. It is built on the firm foundation of the original game and should be a quick learn for experienced players.<br/><br/>There are two main changes to the game: The map is now a 4 by 6 grid tiles representing Germany, and the Directorship, that is, who owns the track is determined by who transported the most players for a company, not who bought the most shares. Additionally, being Director means that you get 5 dice in income during your turn, and not 4 dice.<br/><br/>These two changes alone should make for a very interesting game.<br/><br/>It must be said that the game does not include any new dice. The standard set of dice in the original game has not been expanded. Some of the same rules apply: You only build or lay track on one or two tiles, as soon as you leave a tile, the track dice are removed and the station dice are left behind.<br/><br/>New terrain features are rivers with special crossing rules for them, and that you can only build stations in specific locations indicated on the map. When you build a station at that location, you get the number of passengers for that station, 3,000 or 5,000, plus an additional 1,000 for every &quot;share&quot; symbol or question mark die you spend.

So BRIO gave Alga the task to invent and publish a new letter-tile-laying game with the name Alfapet, while firstly  Spear's (one edition of Scrabble) and later their new owner Mattel, Inc.

The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.<br/><br/>To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition.

When he finishes Basic Training he moves to the Advanced Training spaces and uses the Blue Circle.<br/><br/>If a player covers 3 spaces in a row he may play an additional marker on any space still open to him in that section. Markers left in the Primary Section may also be used by adding the number on the marker's space to the number spun on the spinner.

Lindy, the New Flying Game was a straightforward re-theme of Touring to airplanes delivering airmail. Wings is more of a twist since it has 2 decks of cards--a red deck of Mail Cards, and a blue deck of Delay/Release cards. The Mail cards each depict a city on the players routes. These cities are all numbered and must be played in the correct sequence. For example, #1 Boston must be played before #2 New York, which must be played before #3 Philadelphia and so on until reaching #12 San Francisco. Delay/Release cards either help or hinder the player, or his opponents.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 5 Mail Cards. A player starts his turn by drawing a Mail Card and playing as many cities in sequence as possible. He then draws cards to refill his hand and may play new cards drawn if they continue his city sequence. When he can no longer play red cards he draws 1 card from the blue deck and follows its instructions. These range from High Speed Cards which allow him an extra turn, to Delay Cards which he plays on an opponent; the opponent must play a Release Card before he can add to his city sequence.<br/><br/>The first player to deliver the mail to San Francisco finishes his route and wins.<br/><br/>The plane with registration number N-X-211 pictured on the cards was Charles Lindberg's plane The Spirit of St. Louis. Linderberg did fly for the air mail Service, but not in the The Spirit of St. Louis. The plane was also never marked with &quot;Air Mail&quot; on the tail.<br/><br/>",1928,,,

The deck of cards is then shuffled and a card is placed on all the outer ring spaces (except the corner Location spaces). The remaining cards are then dealt to the players who then shuffle in their Baretta Captures card to the cards they received to form their own draw pile.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves Baretta in any one direction the amount rolled. If he lands on a space with a card, he turns the card over and follows the directions (usually moving him an extra amount of spaces or to a specific location). If he lands on an outer ring space without a card, the player draws the top card from his pile, looks at it, places it on the empty space, and marks it with a token of his color. Eventually players will start placing their Baretta Captures cards on the board and the first player to move Baretta onto his Capture card wins.

Only once during the game can each magician predict a color, whether one of the demon colors or ghostly white, and each magician must predict a different color. (A player predicts a color by placing a pawn of the color in front of him.) This look into the future costs a lot of energy, and as soon as someone predicts a color, he will be harassed by fate and the other magicians. Thus, which color to predict is an important decision as well as when to predict it.<br/><br/>The magician who predicted the color which is the the strongest in the end rules the world.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

13513,Gnomes,[],"['Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Humor']","From the publisher, Tilsit Editions:<br/><br/>In the country of Skaaland, each player heads up a clan of dwarves with only one idea in its collective head: to become Skaal, the royal clan the most respected among all of the dwarves. But getting the respect of the dwarves, who are small but proud, is not a simple matter. You need to be a good gold prospector but also an honoured beer brewer!<br/><br/>After a preliminary placement phase during which the pieces are set up on the game board representing Skaaland (with its regions and villages), each player tries to win respect points.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player may only carry out one of the six available actions. Players can bring new dwarves into the game, move those already on the board, prospect in search of gold, mine discovered gold, open a tavern or move a tavern.<br/><br/>The problem with dwarves is that they're sometimes a little impetuous. For example, if a player discovers gold in a region, a rumour of its discovery immediately propagates across the land and the dwarves from the neighbouring regions arrive at top speed to see the new discovery. Not a moment's peace!<br/><br/>Sometimes, while prospecting, a player runs into &quot;oops&quot; instead. That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.<br/><br/>But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life! Digging is thirsty work and if a clan has a majority in a region, it may open a tavern. If the dwarves are too drunk to dig, then the clan that owns the tavern gains, each turn, respect points equal to the number of dwarves from opposing clans around the tavern. And that's good!<br/><br/>The drunk dwarves either flee this village of debauchery, or return with their buddies and take over the den of iniquity.<br/><br/>Contents: 1 rules insert, 1 game board, 90 dwarf figures, 12 tavern markers, 1 sack of 'gold', 1 sack of 'oops', 1 prospecting pawn, 1 special die.<br/><br/>This game is the 3rd in the Tilsit Collection series.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Tiles played to the table must be connected in such a way that the tracks are joined correctly and the winding train grows longer with each play. A tile may not be placed so that the track turns back upon itself preventing another tile from being added. At first, players may add tiles to both ends of the train. When an engine or caboose is drawn, it must be added to the front or back respectively, thus reducing plays to only one side. When the train has both an engine and a caboose, the game ends. Players count all the cars of their color on the train, and the one with the most cars wins.<br/><br/>",1965,,,
13519,Crusade,[],['Abstract Strategy'],"Crusade - This is the next generation of board games.<br/><br/>What is it?<br/>Crusade is an exciting 2-player board game that is also a three-dimensional card game. If you or anyone you know likes playing card games or thought provoking board games then this is an absolute must-have. Designed with adults in mind it makes a great present for a wide range of ages and will keep both players intrigued every time they play. A typical game lasts about 15~20 minutes so you'll never get bored, you'll never play the same game twice and it really is never over until the last turn of the card. It has very few rules, but for those who prefer not to read rules at all or to have to explain them to new players, each game comes complete with a short 10 minute/side audio-cassette. Side one gives full instructions and an explanation of how to set up the playing pieces, how they move and why. Side two gives simple strategies enough to take you through your first exciting game. Play it once and you've learned it, but it takes memory, luck and cunning to become a really great player. The unique assembly of the playing area and rigid storage box will allow you to play on a full size board, yet when packed away the game is so compact you can take it, or store it, almost anywhere. It is ideal for use in the home, on boats and in caravans. Games are only available direct from the manufacturer and can be ordered by credit card on the secure Internet site or by Fax, Phone and Post.<br/><br/>Crusade had been in development for over 10 years before it was put into production, during that period it was extensively tested and refined, into what we believe is now the most exciting 2-player board game ever. It really is the most addictive game you will ever play, the logo 'never just a game' says it all, we've not met anyone yet who has just played one game and put it back in it's box!<br/><br/>The concept was to create a brand new game that had a timeless theme, a game that could stand the test of time in the same manner as Chess and Checkers (Draughts) this would mean the game could not be linked to any film or television characters as they could only date the game to their own popularity. The game would be designed to be user friendly and instantly familiar, as soon as the first game had been played the contestants should feel as though they have been able to play it all their lives. But in order to keep the players interest, the more times the game would be played the greater the thought would need to go into each move. There should be no complicated rules, the game should flow naturally requiring variations in strategy through a series of constant decisions presented by multiple choices and allow for changes in tactics and objectives as various options and opportunities arose.<br/>The playing arena had to be unique, it was required to be robust but light and of a sufficiently large size to make it have a real presence when in use, yet when dismantled the board needed to be compact and take up as little storage space as possible. The board would also to be designed with the facility of integrating a personalized advertising panel allowing corporate customers to promote their company along side the playing area.<br/>The playing pieces would need to be clearly distinguishable and easy to use as this game would not only be played by adults but also by the young and the elderly.<br/>The traditional problem of explaining rules and strategies to new player would be overcome by including in each game box, in addition to the standard explanation leaflet, an audio-tape of not longer than 10 minutes per side that would explain every aspect of the game and allow instant play.<br/><br/>In the beginning.<br/>We started by examining existing board games and listed their strengths and weaknesses. Probably the most universally well-known board game is Chess; it's been around for over 2000 years so it's certainly stood the test of time. However, great game though it undoubtedly is, it does have basic weaknesses; it's difficult to learn to play well, and a player needs an opponent who is on the same level in order to produce a good contest, a novice or a grand master will provide little entertainment to an average player. Another major factor is, it's enough to give you a headache trying to think all those moves ahead, we wanted a game where you could laugh and joke while you played, our game had to be fun, serious fun. We wanted certain elements of Chess but without the complexity and the seriousness. We accepted that one of the great strengths of Chess was that it allowed for changes in strategy throughout the game and although the game could get very involved, there were actually very few rules. Once you knew how the pieces moved and their relative values that was enough to get you started. Another great strength was the layout of the playing area, very simple and mathematically perfect.<br/>The next choice was to choose what would be the driving force of the game, what made the pieces move. Many traditional board games use dice to determine the moves, well that again we saw that as a weakness, luck plays a very big part in dice games, meaning there is very little skill involved in relation to chance. We decided that a standard pack of playing cards would determine which playing piece moved in Crusade they would give infinitely more permutations to their order of play than dice, as well as the fact that a pack of playing cards is familiar to everyone.<br/><br/>Armed with this basic criteria for a new game we stripped out all the other aspects linked with existing board games that we considered not acceptable so:<br/><br/>Out went the boring type of game that seems to go on for days, but you can tell who's going to win after the first half hour.<br/>Excitement is built in to Crusade, it's a quick, yet thought provoking game. Each game will last on average about 15-20 minutes and you'll need memory, luck and cunning in order to become a great player.<br/><br/>Out went the endless pages of rules; so complicated and ambiguous that you spent more time reading them than playing the game and the difficulties of explaining to new players what a game is all about is also resolved.<br/>Crusade has very few rules; it's based more on an understanding of the playing pieces objectives and how they move around the board. Play it once and you've learned it, perhaps the strangest thing is, in no time at all, you'll feel you've played it all your life. To help you learn to play in minutes and to explain the game to new players, each game comes complete with a short audio-cassette. Side 1 explains how to set out the pieces, how they move and why, and how to play the game. Side 2 provides hints on strategies and details a full demonstration game.<br/><br/>Out went the old fashioned cardboard playing area with the unsightly crease down the center, that folded away into a weird long flat box, which you couldn't seem to store anywhere.<br/>Crusade has a sturdy four piece high quality molded game-board that twists together in seconds to produce a full size playing arena, yet when dismantled it packs away into a specially designed box that gives maximum protection with compact storage. Approximate dimensions in mm. 316L x 162W x 60D (like a shoe box but about half as deep) with a weight of less than 1 kilogram. This makes Crusade not only a fantastic game to keep at home but also the ideal game for use in boats and caravans, where space is at a premium.<br/><br/>Out went the problem of finding a group of people to play with you.<br/>Crusade has been designed to be a 2-player game, because it's far easier to find one person to play with rather than getting together the 4 or 6 people required for some types of board games. Opponents can also be drawn from a vast age range. We recommend it is suitable from 8 years old to Adult, however many below 8 years old can pick up the idea of the game within minutes, as have the many people in their 80's who now enjoy playing. There's a simple handicapping system that allows an expert to have an interesting and exciting game with a complete novice, but nobody stays a novice for long. Even playing with people who do not speak your language is not a barrier; the game becomes self-explanatory by just watching it being played. You will become familiar with Crusade quite literally within minutes, you can play time and time again but you'll never play the same game twice. Each game is a new challenge and throughout the game, even if at times your position doesn't look strong, you still have a chance of winning right up to the very end. It's totally absorbing and never over until the last card is played.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

The player who holds the next higher card in the suit (regardless of where they sit at the table) must follow, laying the card down on the table (D4 followed by D5 for example). Then whoever holds the next higher card plays that, thus continuing in sequence (unless blocked) until the high card of the suit is reached.<br/><br/>Whoever plays the high card (or blocks) gains the Lead, and starts a new sequence by playing any suit card from his hand, thus getting rid of two of his cards.

You then Lead the next sequence, thus getting rid of three of your cards. As the hand continues, natural blocks occur due to players leading with cards in the middle of suits. The player who plays the A5 or the A10 card wins an immediate 5 or 10 points respectively.<br/><br/>When a player plays his last card, the hand ends, and that player receives 1 point for every card left in the other player's hands.

The difference is that instead of a ball the game uses a battery operated plastic car (driven by Benny) which moves around the playing field all by itself.

13571,Dr. Fusby MD,['Memory'],"['Card Game', 'Memory']","Dr. Busby is the first game to sell so many copies, that it is considered as having started the game craze in the United States.<br/><br/>HISTORY:<br/>According to the March 7, 1843 Salem Gazette newspaper, The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby was first published by W. &amp; S. B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts and went on sale that date. In the May 1843 Boys and Girls magazine, the components of the first edition were described: a gold embossed thumb-hole cloth (maroon) case with printed instructions card (yellow) and four sets of 5 cards, each set outlined in a different color: brown for the Busby family, red for the Doll (the dairymaid) family, yellow for the Ninny-come-twitch family, and blue for the Gardner's family.<br/><br/>S(tephen). B. Ives continued to hold the Ives' games copyrights after he and his brother William dissolved the business in April, 1854 (as mentioned in William's newspaer, The Salem Observer).<br/><br/>Stephen's son, Henry P. Ives partnered with A. Augustus Smith to take over the business until Henry bought Smith out in 1861 according to the 1861 Salem directory.<br/><br/>Stephen, his son Henry, and elder son David (with a dry goods business in Boston) continued to publish the game until 1887 when the last remaining Ives' family member, Henry, sold the copyrights to George S. Parker.<br/><br/>During the interimum, editions were printed by the Ives' family with Milton Bradley labels, Henry P. Ives and Selchow &amp; Righter labels, S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow labels, and S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow and E. I. Horseman labels.<br/><br/>According to a letter many publishers were associated with Dr. Busby until 1886 but they really were purchasing and reselling Ives' published games.<br/><br/>In the 1890's McLoughlin Brothers ignored the copyright and put out there own version as did many other major American game manufacturers. That is why you see so many publishers of Dr. Busby in the 1890s.<br/><br/>George S(winterton) Parker made grandiose claims about the games he published which lead to a number of mistakes by historians who failed to go back to the primary sources when describing the history of Dr. Busby.<br/><br/>Consequently,  sParker Brothers rulebook...<br/><br/>&quot;This game was the first ever published in America, being brought out of Salem in 1840.&quot;<br/><br/>Anne Wales Abbot may have first made a prototype of Dr. Busby in 1840 but there are no primary sources to prove this is the case. It may be because the first edition that was published by W. &amp; S. B. Ives is called The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby. Before that published edition with an 1843 copyright, no other earlier editions have been found with or without a copyright date.<br/><br/>George S. Parker, in his 1895 edition of the board game, The Mansion Of Hapiness, made another incorrect claim. The game box cover states that The Mansion Of Happiness was the first board game published in America. There are at least three copies of F. &amp; R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through The United States (copyright 1882) and one copy of F. &amp;. R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through Europe in private and museum collections. So Parker was wrong in this claim too.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/>The game consists of 20 cards, divided into 4 families: the Busby Family, the Dairymaid's Family, the Ninnycometwitch Family, and the Gardener's Family. Each family has 5 members, for example the Busby Family consists of Dr. Busby, his Wife, Son, Servant and Dairymaid's black-eyed Lover.<br/><br/>The starting player begins by asking the player on his right for any card not in his own hand. If that player has the card he calls for, he gives it to him and the starting player may call for another card and so on until he calls for a card which the player doesn't have. Then the next player takes his turn, but must first call for those cards which have been called for and obtained by the first player. Thus it becomes a game of memory since any incorrect call ends a turn. When a player has called every card from the player on the right (thus putting that player out of the game), he may continue to call from the next player on the right. At the end of the game, the winner will have successfully called all the cards into his own hand.<br/><br/>",1840,,,

The tiles are shuffled and dealt evenly to all the players.<br/><br/>On your turn, you play as many tiles as you can to spell out the phrase line-by-line. If you don't have a play, you may draw a tile from the player on your left, and should this tile be the desired letter, you may place it and continue playing from your hand. Points are scored as a line is completed.<br/><br/>The word &quot;BUTTON,&quot; together with the comma makes up the first (and second) line, and scores 10 points for the player playing the comma. The words &quot;WHO&quot; &quot;HAS&quot; &quot;THE&quot; make up the third, forth and fifth line, and score 5 points for the player playing the the last letter in each word respectively. The word &quot;BUTTON?&quot; makes up the sixth line and scores 10 points to the player playing the question mark. The tile with the picture of a button makes up the seventh line and is worth 20 points. The first player to score 100 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",1910,,,

13575,Bunny Zick-Zack,['Betting and Bluffing'],['Racing'],"This Doris and Frank game is closely related to their earlier published Eselsrennen (1982). Differences are - only a one sided board which supports a three bunny (pawn) race. The mechanics are pretty much the same:<br/><br/>Players are given a card secretly, each showing the bunny's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the bunnies. When you move a bunny onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green bunny one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue bunny on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final bunny because it is blocked or it lands on a space of its own color. Eventually, the bunnies cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins.<br/><br/>Funny and quick puzzle-racing game and one of the (if not the) first games published by Doris and Frank.<br/><br/>",1991,,,

Different fields trigger different events or actions, such as choosing a job, buying a house or a car, environmental problems appearing, etc. Each player has markers on the scales for the three parameters, but the society at large (all players) also live in certain conditions, represented by low resources, a bad environment, etc. Depending on these, the actions of the players are evaluated differently. For instance, a player who buys a car pays money out of his/her income, gains personal possibilities but lowers his/her health. Depending on the environmental situation of all players, more or less points are deducted at the end of a turn.<br/><br/>A player who has completed a circuit places evaluation markers on his/her current situation.

13584,Clan War,"['Campaign / Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling']","['Fantasy', 'Miniatures']","A fantasy Miniatures game based on Legend of the Five Rings, which combines a use of a card deck with a d10 based rolling system.  It is based on a fantasy setting heavily influenced by feudal Japan with Samurai of various clans fighting to support their lord's quest to become Emperor. There are also shugenja (mages), Dragons, Naga, and hordes of evil demons (Oni). You get a certain number of points to build an army, and armies must typically have units that are either from the same clan or unaligned. You can be units from other clans, but they cost a premium (usually 20% above list price).  Typically, personalities lead units, which is some number of basic troops (usually samurai). A good personality can cost as much as 30 or 40 basic troops, but most cost around 10 times more. Leaders, and occasionally units, have skills. Skills are used to modify initiatives, absorb damage, boost morale, and the like. Many personalities (and some units) also have skills that are unique to that personality / unit.<br/><br/>In addition to the units, each player also has a customized deck of thirty cards. These cards let the player make special moves, pass morale tests, and do other acts of courage. Each player builds their own deck (just like in a collectable card game) and typically draws a card a turn, although one player gets to draw two. Since a game lasts about 6-10 turns, a player should expect to see 1/3 rd to 1/2 of their deck (you start with three cards) in a battle.<br/><br/>After setting up, a turn looks like the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Determine Initiatives,<br/>     Do Special Action/Orders,<br/>     Move,<br/>     Cavalry Move Again,<br/>     Shoot,<br/>     Fight,<br/>     Reserve Movement.<br/><br/><br/>(Detail from the review by Bankler: <a target='_blank' href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/68739/clan-war-review"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer noopener"">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/68739/clan-war-review</a>)<br/><br/>",1998,,,

You may decide to be a Conference line or an Independent line.<br/><br/>You may decide to sail from Northport, Southport or Gulfport. You may decide to accept cargo, pass, or bid competitively for it.<br/><br/>Every day on the North Atlantic, ships cross the ocean, carrying American cago for sale in Europe. A week or so later, these same ships are unloaded and refilled with containers of European goods, which are brought back to America.<br/><br/>Some of the shipping lines belong to a Conference, an association in which all members agree to charge the same rates and do business in an identical way to other Conference members. Some shipping lines remain Independent, which means they set their own rates (generally slightly lower than Conference rates) and do business in a way they feel is best for them and their customers.<br/><br/>Some ships sail from Northern parts, and others sail from Southern or Gulf Coast parts, where the weather at sea is generally calmer.<br/><br/>Shipping lines naturally prefer to carry cargo which pays the highest rate and often bid against each other to win an account. If they lose the bid, sometimes they must sail with an empty container. Some lines prefer to carry lower-priced cargo since they would rather have a lower profit than no profit at all, which is the case when you have to sail with an empty container.<br/><br/>In the real world, of course, there are many more things to consider when you own a shipping line.

These numbers and abilities are listed on a Data Card, an easy to read record sheet about the size of a standard poker card and freely downloadable here at reapergames.com. A key component of the R.A.G.E. system is the Damage Track.

As a model takes damage, its stats change to reflect its changing performance on the field of battle!<br/><br/>Tabletop Miniatures Games:<br/>Reaper's tabletop miniature games are played with plastic and/or metal 28mm miniatures on a large flat surface - typically a 4' x 4' square table. Each player will need to build an army using the various 28mm plastic and/or metal miniatures that Reaper produces in its various product lines.<br/><br/>Reaper produces an official line of Warlord miniatures for use with the game.

It is an extension of  The Siege Game, a.k.a. German Tactics which itself seems descended from Fox and Geese. In this game, 17 points of its 67-point game board are set aside as a garrison. Three officers begin play in the garrison, and fifty attackers begin play on all the remaining points of the board. Officers can move in any direction along any lines and jump over attackers to remove them from the board; attackers move only along vertical or diagonal lines towards the garrison and cannot capture officers, but instead merely try to swarm the garrison. To win, the attackers must occupy every point in the garrison, while the officers must capture enough attackers to make such occupation impossible.<br/><br/>This game has been known in English-speaking countries by a number of names, including Officers and Sepoys, The Royal Garrison, The Three Guardsmen, The Three Musketeers, Yellow Peril, and Bataan: The Battle of the Philippines!.

Rules, hazards and bonuses of the game are based on hydroplane racing which annually draws hundreds of thousands of spectators to such events as the Gold Cup: Seattle Seafair Trophy race on Lake Washington; President's Cup: Potomac River, Washington, D.C.; Silver Cup: Detroit River, Detroit Michigan; Apple Cup: Lake Chelan, Washington; Governor's Cup: Madison, Indiana; Sahara Cup: Lake Mead, Nevada, and many others.&quot;<br/><br/>The Game's components consist of the following:<br/>A plain, narrow cardboard Box bottom, with a matching WHITE Box Top with &quot;Roostertail!&quot; in RED print, &quot;The Hydroplane Racing Game...&quot; in Dark BLUE print and a colorful picture of (3)-Hydros with accompanying 'roostertails'!

13709,Clash of Giants II: 1st Ypres & Galicia 1914,"['Chit-Pull System', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Wargame', 'World War I']","Clash of Giants II: The Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914 is the sequel to Ted Raicer's acclaimed Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914. As with the original design, CoG II contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering two of the most interesting (and least-gamed) campaigns of the First World War, Galicia and First Ypres .<br/><br/> Galicia 1914  pitted the armies of Tsarist Russia and Habsburg Austria-Hungary in a ferocious struggle along a 200 mile front. The Austrian commander, General Conrad, refused to wait for the arrival of his 2nd Army, which had been initially deployed to the Serbian front, before going onto the offensive. The Austrian attack began on 19 August, with Conrad's 1st and 4th Armies on the Austrian left flank striking the Russian 4th and 5th Armies on the Tsarist right. The Austrians outnumbered the Russians on this flank, and initially drove them back, and Conrad began to dream of pocketing the entire Russian army group. But the absence of the Austrian 2nd Army gave the Russians an even greater numerical advantage on the opposite flank, as two Russian armies (the 3rd and 8th) struck the Austrian 3rd east of Lemberg (Lvov). Soon it was Conrad's armies that were in danger of being cut off and destroyed. The campaign was a catastrophe for Austria-Hungary, but in the end the result was a fatally incomplete victory for the Russians.<br/><br/>The  First Ypres  game is the first game to cover the climax of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; on the Western Front that followed the inconclusive Allied victory at the Marne. By 8 October the continued outflanking attempts by both sides had nearly reached the English Channel. A massive meeting engagement developed, with the Germans first attempting to launch a massive cavalry raid around the Allied northern flank in the direction of Abbeville. When this fizzled (due to the timely arrival of a French infantry corps), the French and British began their own offensive aimed at driving all the way to the German border. But the Allied attack quickly ran into German troops of the 6th Army, hurried north from Alsace-Lorraine. Falkenhayn, the German commander, now planned to play his trump card, striking the BEF with four newly-raised reserve corps of hurriedly-trained but enthusiastic volunteers. In a month of brutal struggle in which the British lost 60,000 men, the Germans lost well over 100,000. Not realizing that the BEF had been bled white and was on the point of breaking, Falkenhayn called off his attacks in mid-November. The attempts to end the war by Christmas were over.<br/><br/>Clash of Giants II uses a slightly modified version of the original system to model these dynamic and closely balanced contests. As in Clash of Giants, the game emphasizes the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll. But CoGII adds an interactive random chit-pull activation sequence, so that neither player knows which of his commands will move next. Each player has only one combat phase per turn, which he may declare at the end of any one of his command activations, but which covers the entire map. This leads to many difficult game decisions: &quot;Do I declare combat now, with only part of my forces in position to attack, or wait hoping to get more units into the line, but risking the enemy either pulling back or striking first?&quot;<br/><br/>Once combat is declared, CoGII uses the unique combat system so popular in Tannenberg and Marne, in which a unit's training, equipment, and morale are factored into a Tactical Effiency Rating that often counts more than mere numbers.<br/><br/>Galicia 1914 includes a corps/division OB and a map scaled at 9 miles to the hex that covers the entire front from Krakow to the Romanian border. The victory conditions force the Austrian player to attack initially in order to gain enough VPs to survive the strong Russian offensive certain to follow. Galicia features special rules for the great Austrian fortress of Przemysl, Russian cavalry replacements, rail supply, Offensive Support Markers (representing heavy artillery and the logistical and command preparations of a major assault), and the arrival of the Austrian 2nd Army.<br/>The OB for First Ypres is at division level (with the odd brigade). The map scale is 3.3 miles to the hex, from Lens in the south to the English Channel. Special rules include Offensive Support Markers, the Belgian retreat onto the map from Antwerp, flooding the Yser River line, French and German cavalry replacements, unknown Tactical Efficiency Ratings for the German New Reserve Corps, and British tenacity (represented by remnant counters). Victory goes to the player who controls 5 of the 9 victory hexes at the end of the game, and the game is sometimes decided on the final combat roll by a last-ditch attack or defense of a single key hex.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; backprinted game map<br/>    Two 8.5 x 11 Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 5/8&quot; Countersheets<br/>    Two Six-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT Games website)<br/><br/>",2006,,,

An opponent's piece is taken by custodial capture, i.e., by being sandwiched horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) between a player's own pieces.  A piece must be moved into such a postion immediately on either side of an opponent's piece to make a capture, but multiple captures can be made simultaneously.

Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.<br/><br/>When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.<br/><br/>The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.<br/><br/>At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.<br/><br/>An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete.

One set gives Spain and Turkey their own player, who controls both countries but does not have total freedom of action. And then there's the one players have demanded since the day we released John Prados' Third Reich: jet fighters. New jet fighter counters for Germany, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan. Sporting the lovely graphics you've come to expect of the Me262, Gloster Meteor, Nakajima Kikka and more. A set of variant rules now requires that major powers build their jets once the science becomes available, rather than receiving an instant upgrade, and the technology can be captured.<br/><br/>There are new political markers included, allowing Germany to develop advanced submarines, V1 and V2 missiles, and the atomic bomb. The German player has to pay a stiff economic and military price for such science, however. There are V1 and V2 unit counters, too.<br/><br/>Drawing on the tradition of the original edition, we've also added a set of pre-war options players can add to spice up their games: Italian and Polish re-armament, the German Z-Plan, Japanese tank development, a Republican Spain, hard-fighting Austrians, Soviet naval development and more.<br/><br/>The book's centerpiece is a series of strategy articles, analyzing the positions of every player in both the separate games and the combined scenarios. There are also guides to key concepts like economic warfare.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Pieces capture other pieces by jumping over them.

The Hungarians numbered around 35,000 (including artillerist), the Ottomans, about 60,000. While there is much disagreement about numbers at this battle, all sources agree that the Ottomans did outnumber the Hungarians significantly. The Hungarian front line was stretched rather thinly to match, or attempt to match, the frontage that would be presented by the Ottomans. The Hungarians had, as was the practice for the last 200 years in European warfare, dug a trench in front of their front line infantry and artillery to give them a defense advantage. The actual battle, which started at around 3:00 PM, lasted but a few hours, maybe less.<br/><br/>Each combat unit represents about 750 men. The map scale is about 225 yards per hex and depicts the flat and, because of the proximity of the oft-overflowing Danube, somewhat soft and, in many places, slippery battlefield at Mohacs.<br/><br/>Suleiman the Magnificent is an accessible, fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. Optional rules include the politically charged issue that has reverberated down over the centuries, that many of the contingents of allies called in by Hungarian King Lajos did not arrive in time for the battle. Some were never going to do so; some were held back - specifically the charge leveled at Johann Szapolyai, Voivode of Transylvania because of his ambitions for the Hungarian throne (which he did get after Lajos' death and some deals reached with Suleiman).<br/><br/>Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map <br/>240 full color die cut counters <br/>Rulebook length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages <br/>Complexity - Low <br/>Solitaire suitability - Medium <br/>Playing time - 2 hours<br/><br/>Design - Richard Berg<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh <br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>",2004,,,

His opponents had none of these -- but they did have overwhelming strength instead.<br/><br/>In 1815, Napoleon had the advantage of surprise and concentration.  His opponents were rapidly joining together.  A quick, decisive strike on each separated army by Napoleon could have spelled victory for the French, instead of defeat at Waterloo.<br/><br/>In NAPOLEON'S LAST CAMPAIGNS you are faced with the intriguing possibilities for tactical and strategic maneuvers presented by both of these classic campaigns and the fate of victory or defeat lies in your hands and mind.&quot;<br/><br/>Description of Game Components:<br/><br/>Two color map, 16&quot; x 14&quot;, depicting North-eastern France from Paris on the west edge of the map to Brussels in the North and Mainz in the East.

Rivers and mountains do not hinder movement.  Forest areas take two turns to enter.    French units (ONLY) with supply points may attempt to Force March and move two areas in a turn.

The difference between commander ratings also modify the die roll result.  Then the die is rolled on an odds based Combat Results Table and result number is modified by the die-roll modification number determined in the first step.  Combat losses are taken as a percentage of the of the losing forces combat strength.  Combat results can also result in the retreat (one area) of the attacker or defender.<br/><br/>",1974,,,

Green cards are positive (such as donating money or following regulations) and allow you to take chits or move forwards.  The winner is the player who makes it to the final space -- so long as that player has not lost all chits.<br/><br/>This is a straightforward luck-of-the-die game, but is notable for its educational bent and its unusual artwork.

In the standard 4-player form of the game, the game has two teams - the fielding team and the batting team. On the fielding team one player takes the role of the bowler while the other takes the fielder role. On the batting team the two players each take the role of the batsmen.  The batting team will have ten overs to score runs, unless the bowling team can take ten wickets first. The team with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>How it works: The game contains three decks of cards; batting, bowling, fielding. Each over, the batter, the bowler and fielder receive a new set of possible deliveries(bowling cards), shot options (batting cards) and field positions (field cards).<br/>The bowler will try to restrict runs, bowl the batter or appeal for LBW. The batter will try to smash a six. But no, you'll only be able to get a single off that one.<br/><br/>There are optional rules for a two-player game.<br/><br/>The game is broadly speaking a trick-taking card game where the player controlling the batsman tries to follow suit and play a lower-valued card than the bowler.

13845,Charlie's Year,['Point to Point Movement'],"['Age of Reason', 'Wargame']","From the Publisher:<br/><br/>As the title indicates, Charlie's Year covers the events of the last real threat to the Georgian regime of Great Britain and to the social, economic, and philosophical gains of the Glorious Revolution. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. In late August of 1745, Charles Edward Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, landed at Loch nam Uamh with seven men, raised the Standard of the outcast Stuart kings at Glenfinnan, and gathered to himself an army to challenge the might of King George II's realm. Composed of wild Highlanders, Lowland peasants, discontented gentlemen and diehard Jacobite nobles, the Pretender's army defeated the local garrison forces and laid all Scotland at his feet. A descent on England should now have given the Prince's reluctant French allies the diversion they needed to invade. Marching on London however, the Jacobites lost their nerve after reaching Derby and retreated, pursued now by the best regiments of the British Army. The French, working with information a couple of weeks out of date, were still not ready to aid them.<br/><br/>Confronting each other at the battle of Falkirk in the winter of 1745, neither side appeared to prevail, and both withdrew to lick their wounds. However the tide of war was now firmly against the Jacks, and they withdrew again into the mountain fastnesses of Scotland, hoping to wage a guerrilla war and so encourage the French. The idea proved impractical, especially in mid-winter, and in the wet spring of 1746, the British Army under the Duke of Cumberland met the remaining Jacobite forces under Charlie himself at the battle of Culloden and crushed them. While Scotland suffered the fire and sword of the conqueror, the Prince flitted through the heather, and after many romantic adventures escaped to France, never to return. His allies the French were unconcerned, as the withdrawal of the British Army from Flanders allowed them to seize the vital port of Antwerp and a number of key fortifications necessary for taking the war to the Austrian Netherlands. At war's end, the price for surrendering these gains would be the fortress of Louisburg, Nova Scotia and the temporary restoration of French colonial dominance in North America.<br/><br/>Expanded by: The Highland Quorum<br/><br/>",2004,,,
13846,Cockpit of Europe: France & Flanders 1744-48,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Age of Reason', 'Wargame']","From the Manufacturer:<br/><br/>Cockpit of Europe (CoE) covers the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession in the Flanders theater between 1744 and 1748. From 1741 to 1748, the War of the Austrian Succession raged on the continent of Europe. From 1743 on, Britain and France were formally at war. The French leadership were divided into two schools of thought. The traditionalists believed that the Habsburg dynasty was the primary threat to France's position in Europe, and that the main thrust of the war should be made against their possessions in Italy and Germany. The other school feared the rise of the Maritime Powers (England and Holland) and counseled a hard blow in that direction. CoE looks at the five years that the French spent in the Low Countries attempting to smash the ring of enemies surrounding them.<br/><br/>Even though the French, thanks to the sublime leadership of their German-born Marshal, Maurice de Saxe, conquered Belgium and invaded Holland, defeating every army sent against them, the campaigns resulted in a draw. The subsequent peace merely restored the status quo. The stage was then set for the titanic Seven Years War.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there is great scope for you as the King's Captain General. The armies involved were the largest yet seen on a European battlefield &amp;#8800; the French fielded over 200,000 men, and the Allies tried their best to match them. The region is relatively compact, yet difficult to operate in, with the open country thickly studded with fortresses and cut by rivers. Seaward are tracts of swamp and fenland. On the other flank are the dense woods and rugged hills of the Ardennes.<br/><br/>The French player, with the strategic initiative, must constantly press forward, laying siege to town after town (and leaving many men idle in garrison), as he seeks to lever the Allies away from the French frontiers and ultimately threaten the Allies' own bases of operation. The Allied player must decide whether to defend everywhere, to bide his time and harass the enemy, or to launch an offensive of his own. Even if he makes the right choice, however, he must still get the agreement of all the nations under his command<br/><br/>",2004,,,
13847,The Highland Quorum,['Point to Point Movement'],"['Age of Reason', 'Expansion for Base-game', 'Wargame']","From the Manufacturer:<br/><br/>THQ is a study of a less known Jacobite Rebellion, the '15. In 1714, Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs, passed away. Her successor by law was the German George Augustus Welf, Elector of Hanover, who became King George I. But the new regime was far from stable. Only the Whig Party - the forerunners of the Liberals - supported him. He consigned the Tories (the later Conservative Party) to the political wilderness for their part in making peace with France separately from the German states in 1713. The overt supporters of his rival, James Edward Stuart - the Jacobites - were forced to flee or go into hiding.<br/><br/>George took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. One such man was John Erskine, Earl of Mar, late Secretary of State for Scotland, but now unemployed. Mar belonged to no party (if you except the Earl of Mar's Retirement Assurance Association, which was more of a special interest group) but he was identified with the old Tory regime and had ties to the Scottish Jacobites. He offered his services to George, only to be publicly snubbed. Frustrated, he traveled to Scotland, and began to fan the flames of rebellion.<br/><br/>Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, for which Mar was largely responsible. A persuasive man, he now began to organize a coalition of those opposed to the Union and those opposed to King George. The Loyalists, led by the Whig Duke of Argyle (who had ironically opposed the Union) were alarmed, but the Government took no notice, its members still scrambling for &quot;places&quot; under the new Administration. With the heather aflame, on the 6th of September 1715, the Royal Standard of the Stuarts went up on the Braes of Mar, before a crowd of 600 that would shortly swell to over 12,000. But, as the Standard went up, the gilt ball on the top of the flagpole fell off&auml;<br/><br/>",2004,,,

13862,Picturesque Places in the Northland,"['Roll / Spin and Move', 'Set Collection']",['Economic'],"Ostensibly a Monopoly-style roll-and-move game, this apparently sparsely-produced game centered around Flagstaff, AZ, has players gaining property in a more abstract method.  The board is laid out in the traditional square with properties lined up on each side and neutral spaces in the corners.  Properties are colored in one of four colors which correspond to the &quot;se-va&quot; or money notes.  Instead of purchasing properties landed upon, players instead arbitrarily pick up a note of that property's color when they land there, until one player has ten notes of that color and becomes &quot;owner&quot; of that color so long as they have more than ten notes of that color; when players subsequently land on that color they must pay the player that controls that color three notes of that color.  If unable to pay three notes of that color, they must pay the banker or &quot;Escrow Agent&quot; five notes of any color.  If a player does not have enough notes to pay the Escrow Agent, they are eliminated from the game.  Though not spelled out entirely, the winner of the game is apparently the last player remaining.  Additionally there are spaces on the board that correspond to the &quot;Rattlesnake Pit&quot; and &quot;Kachina&quot; decks, with the former as detrimental &quot;se-va&quot; losing cards and the latter as beneficial &quot;se-va&quot; gaining cards.<br/><br/>As an editorial aside, some people refer to games as &quot;Multi-Player Solitaire&quot;; this game truly qualifies as such.  The _only_ decisions that players can make that affect the outcome of the game are what colors of &quot;se-va&quot; notes to pay the Escrow Agent when they do not have enough of a single color to pay a property owner, and what color or colors to pay when they draw a &quot;Rattlesnake Pit&quot; card.  Every other decision is governed by the state of the game and cannot be impacted by the players.<br/><br/>",1980,,,

The German player is on the offensive, seeking to win by controlling Moscow and other key cities. The Soviet player, though mostly defending, must watch for opportunities to deliver counterattacks against the Germans in order to inflict a decisive defeat upon them or upset the Axis alliance. <br/> Operation Kremlin's orders of battle are extrapolated from both sides' historic organizational charts of mid to late 1942. The Germans have the units which composed Army Group Center on 28 June 1942, along with all the panzer corps that were deployed elsewhere on the Russian Front. Manstein's 11th Army enters as reinforcement once Sevastopol falls. The Germans also have the Axis satellite armies, on the assumption that their own governments would have wanted to be able to claim participation in this &quot;final and decisive&quot; campaign in Russia.<br/><br/>The Soviet order of battle is based on their front line deployment of 28 June, along with all their Operational and Strategic reserves, plus just about everything they generated in the way of replacements and reinforcements during the time period of the historic Stalingrad campaign.<br/><br/>Each hex represents approximately 10 miles (16.2 kilometers) from side to side.

13883,Jenseits von Theben,['Turn Order: Time Track'],"['Exploration', 'Travel']","This entry is for the original Jenseits von Theben; for the new printing by Queen, go to Thebes.<br/><br/>Jenseits von Theben is a game of competitive archeology.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.<br/><br/>The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time&quot;.  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.<br/><br/>In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.<br/><br/>The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Thebes<br/><br/><br/>",2004,,,

There are also special cards marked 'upside down' that change the polarity of the cards in a players hand.<br/><br/>On his or her turn a player takes the top card from the draw deck, banks one set of cards if possible, and then passes one card to the left.  'Upside down' cards may not be passed to another player.<br/><br/>A set of three identical cards may be 'banked' during a players turn.  When one player has banked three sets of cards the round ends and the players score their hands.<br/><br/>All banked cards, whether plus or minus, score plus the face value of the set.  For example three +10 cards score 10 points and three -6 cards score 6 points.  Three 'upside down' cards may be banked for a score of 0.<br/><br/>All the cards in each players' hand are then added together to determine how many points are scored.  An 'Upside down' card in the players hand causes all + cards to become - and all - cards to become +.

Players normally take one car each, or a cycle pack, picked randomly with a die roll on the encounter chart.  (Used for generating random traffic.)<br/><br/>Mechanics are a lot simpler than most games of this type - movement is composed of making lane changes and moving forward based on your speed.  Acceleration/deceleration and movement is plotted secretly, then simultaneously revealed - each turn each car will move one space forwards or sideways for each 10 MPH of speed, broken up into four phases. (Scale is 20 feet per square.)<br/><br/>Only one car (or two motorcycles) is allowed per square - if two cars try to move together they 'bump' and start rolling for critical damage.  Players can roll to make 'emergency' changes to their plotted movement (which is restricted, for example a 'right' move can never be changed into a 'left' move.)<br/><br/>Combat occurs at the end of every phase.  Drivers can fire one turret, (a group of weapons mounted in one of eight directions) gunners can fire two.  Any/all weapons can be fired each phase, which makes for a lot of shooting opportunities, which is good since weapons only fire in a straight line (front/back/right/left/diagonals.)<br/><br/>Scenarios include the basic duel, &quot;Rush Hour&quot; where there is a chance for random traffic to enter the highway (is what the on-ramp is used for) and a Death Race with 3 to 5 players racing sets of identical cars.<br/><br/>The game comes in a small box, closed with a folding flap like a satchel, complete with 3 highway boards (so you can put the rear board in front and keep driving) counters for the cars, lots of charts &amp; tables, car control sheets and a rule book.<br/><br/>",1981,,,

Upon a first capture a piece is flipped over to the pawn-side with its movement then reduced to a backwards direction only.  A second capture of the same piece removes it from the game.  Winning is determined by getting your opponent into a position where s/he cannot make a legal move or the capture of all opponents pieces.<br/><br/>",0,,,
13974,Kaji,"['Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']",['Card Game'],"&quot;KAJI is based on a Japanese game (JAN-KEN-PO) centuries old, in which the hands are used as symbols.&quot; A.k.a. Rock-Paper-Scissors. There are four suits of 12 cards each, numbered 1 -12. The suits are JAN (stone), KEN (scissors), PO (paper) and KAJI (fire). The main version is the 4-player (possible partnership) game, with 2, 3 and 5-player variants.<br/><br/>In the 4-player game, 11 cards are dealt to each player and a 4-card NEKO (kitty) is set aside. There is one round of bidding where each player has one opportunity (in clockwise order) to bid on how many tricks over a book of five she will win. High bidder (Declarer) picks up the kitty, discards 4 cards and then sets trump. Declarer may elect to play the hand alone or chooses a partner by asking for a particular card. Whoever holds that card must show it and becomes the Declarer's partner. The remaining 2 players become partners. Seating order is not changed when the partnerships are formed.<br/><br/>When the KAJI suit is trump, the value of the other suits depends upon the order in which the suits are played and follow the  traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock order (JAN-KEN-PO). However, if not declared trump, KAJI is always the second ranking suit (ex: if JAN is trump, suit rank is JAN-KAJI-KEN-PO). Only a higher trump card will beat another card in the trump suit.<br/><br/>Declarer leads any suit. Play proceeds clockwise in turns, and players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she may play any card. If it is a card of lower suit than the previous card, it is regarded as a discard and does not change the current suit. If it is a card of a higher suit, that becomes the current suit. Say Scissors is trump and a Rock card follows a Paper card that is lead. Paper is still the suit to follow or beat. Say Scissors is trump and a Paper card follows a Rock card that is lead. Paper is now the suit ro follow or beat. The winner of each trick leads the next.<br/><br/>When playing in partnership, if the Declarer's partnership achieves or exceeds its bid, each player in the Declarer's partnership scores 5 points for each trick over the book of five that was bid and 10 points per trick over the bid if applicable. If playing alone, Declarer scores 10 points for each trick over the book of five. If Declarer's partnership does not achieve or exceed its bid, each opponent receives 10 points for each trick they fell short. If Declarere is playing alone, opponents receive 20 points for each trick by which the contract failed.<br/><br/>",1935,,,

13977,YY classic (YinYang),[],['Abstract Strategy'],"A board game for 2 to 8 players. The aim of the game is to form a lifeline using matching symbols. The first player to form a lifeline when he places his last stone is the winner. Chinese sticks (dinner-things) are used to allow fate to determine a lifeline. Anticipation and planning largely determine the chance of success. The element of chance means that everyone ultimately has a chance. The game is derived from Chinese philosophy, which says that all things in life must be in balance. Every object has its opposite, or if you like its complementary element. Black and white, man and woman, water and fire. In short, Yin and Yang. It sounds floating but it isn&rsquo;t. Before the game starts the stones are shuffled and placed on the white triangles on the perimeter with the symbols face down. The numbers in the black triangles remain visible. The color of the pawns is also the color of your starting field. Each player drops the three sticks on each turn. Move the total of the throw (6, 7, 8, or 9) on the main field. The used the philosophy that extremes are changeable. You can make a 6 a 7 and a 9 a 8. There are two rounds. In the first round you collect the stones and in the second round you have to make a line (lifeline) between 2 triangles. Therefore, players may lay a stone on the main field on each turn. Each stone laid down must be able to form a pair. This is an import point. It must be able, nothing more than that. Different pairs may be placed against each other. In this way a lifeline can be formed or stones can be played out. The first player to add his last stone to the lifeline is the winner.<br/>It is a new kind of game. You have to get used to it. But after a few times of playing you will find the pleasure of this strategic game.<br/><br/>",2003,,,

The game covers the entire war from the Axis invasion of Russia to the final destruction of the Axis armies four years later.  The Axis  player has a fixed reinforcement rate, but the Russian player must decide what type of units he wants to produce by allocating his available resources.  These decisions are critical to the game as they were in the war.  There are also rules for supply, weather, air power and Axis Minor allies as well as variant campaign game rules.  In addition to the campaign game, there are four yearly scenarios, one for each year 1941-1944, which simulate the situation at key times during the campaign.  Those scenarios cover the Barbarossa Campaign, the Stalingrad Campaign, Kursk and the Destruction of Army Group Center.<br/><br/>Reissued as War in the East: The Russo-German Conflict, 1941-45 (Second Edition) to form part of War in Europe.<br/><br/>",1974,,,

Rivaling Verdun in ferocity, scale and casualties, Somme was Britain's first real chance to open up the Western Front in World War I. French and British allies, wanting to take initiative away from Germany at Verdun, launched a large joint offensive at the Somme, where their fronts met. British generals called it the &quot;Big Push,&quot; to break the trenches and carry them to victory. Here was a campaign that brought little save the cultural annihilation of the participants. Europe never looked at war quite the same way after the Somme.<br/><br/>The British player controls the Allied forces (British and French), while the other player commands the defending German Army. It is also possible to have three players--French, British, and German. Each Game Turn represents one week. Map scale measures approximately 1142 yards per square (squares rather than hexes are used to prevent the easy outflanking of enemy units - something very hard to do in WW1). Ground units range in size from regiments to divisions. Each infantry strength point varies between 700 and 1500 men, depending on nationality and fighting effectiveness. Support units, like artillery, cavalry and tanks, focus their strength more on relative fire power and attack force. Play begins with artillery fire, where the other player may throw in his counter battery fire to offset the barrages. Ground movement comes next, followed by the declaration of assaults, appeals to command center resources, and defensive fire. After assaults take place, the phasing player introduces replacements and tries to rally his disordered units.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

The Russian plan was to subdue the city with a massive show of force to intimidate its populace into submission. This approach had worked in 1991, and Moscow saw no reason why a repeat performance would not again suffice. Massive artillery and air support were not thought essential, as the long columns of tanks and their two battalions of mechanized infantry support were deemed sufficient to cower any who chose to witness.<br/><br/>Alerted to the Russians' plan of entry, two battalions of Chechen resistance fighters flitted among the sewers and rooftops to greet the Russian force. Well-armed with RPG's and mortars and backed by snipers, the defenders deployed small groups of hunter-killer teams to tackle any armor encountered. A battle for the city was set.<br/><br/>Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players can brutally harm their opponent, while each has liabilities to protect.

There are no specific turns, and play simply passes back and forth between the two sides, possibly interrupted by the abilities of the opposing commanders.

In the castle are twelve labeled castle sections (drawbridge, six towers, king's court, dungeon, kitchen, rosengarden and dining hall) which players will try to own -- denoted by holding a card with the corresponding name.<br/><br/>Players all begin on the Start space with fifty gold pieces and roll the single die to move forward. Landing on a castle section allows buying that section, or, if it is already owned, forces payment of half the purchase price to the owner. Costs range from six to the most expensive section, the Drawbridge, which costs twenty. No section may be purchased until the Drawbridge has been. Other spaces on the board force drawing a card from one of three available decks which may have a cost to use: Move (free) moves the player to another space; Give (costs two) has various positive and negative effects; Receive (costs two) is similar to Give; Wishing Well (costs ten) has various effects including the Key to the Royal Bedroom. No one can win without the Key card. In addition, it is necessary to own at least half the castle sections.<br/><br/>Other spaces on the board force payment of tax, placed in the center of the board, or the chance to claim all the collected taxes. There are also three Flogging spaces where the player must either pay ten to avoid the flogging and take another turn or else roll a single die and risk going to the Dungeon. Players in the Dungeon languish there until another player is sent to the Dungeon, at which point they pay the new player one gold and resume play. The only other spaces on the board are one each to pick a player to lose a turn and to choose a player to be sent to the Dungeon.<br/><br/>",1986,,,

New Amici has set as its goal to tune up people's often only limited knowledge of foreign languages, so that players can make new friends when on vacation abroad.<br/><br/>Up to four teams / solo players in two different nationalities take part, independent of language knowledge or age. By virtue of three difficulty levels, played in parallel, even novices can stand a chance against advanced speakers and learn the basics of the language along the way. The game works in two directions: people that normally speak German, for example, but wish to learn English can play the English-German version with English speakers who wish to learn German. Both profit from each other. But even players who all have the same mother tongue can play. The correct pronunciation of words in foreign languages is no problem, as New Amici uses a unique phonetic system that doesn't require any advance knowledge. Unlike the dictionaries, the words are spelled using 'normal' alphabet letters instead of phonetic symbols.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to win cards over three rounds. This is accomplished by translating cards in both the mother tongue as well as the foreign language. Novices have to translate simple words, advanced players have to translate tougher cards. In addition to vocabulary know-how, New Amici also provides information about countries and peoples. In addition to words, sentences and idiomatic expressions, there are also cards with information about culture, business, as well as food and drink. The next rounds begins after seven cards have been won. The winner is the player who, in the finals, translates all of the played cards error-free.<br/><br/>The game has sold over 42,000 copies in Norway. In Germany, it is being distributed through toy stores, department stores, as well as book stores. Thus far, four versions are available for the suggested retail price of 39.90 Euros: German-English, German-French, German-Spanish, German-Italian.

The box is then turned around several times, so that nobody can remember exactly where each color of worm is located any more! Each child then receives cards with baby worms of various colors, after which the game begins.<br/><br/>In turn order, each child tries to find a worm of the colour that matches their topmost card. This they do by carefully digging in the sand. What color appears? If it's the right one, then that child gets to try and reveal a worm that matches their next card. If it's the wrong one, then maybe he'll have better luck next time, once several worms have been discovered. The box is turned around at the end of each round, so players have to pay close attention to where the worms are! At the end of the game, once all cards have been assigned to their worms, each child gets to place a marker where they think a worm of the matching colour is located. Then comes the exciting ending: one child gets to rattle the box until all of the worms have poked their heads out of the sand.

The category is revealed but the first player on the left has to ask questions that result in a yes or no answer whilst the sixty second timer is running.  If he/she gets the right answer then they win the card, if not then the next player on the left (and so on) can attempt to get the right answer until someone wins the cards.  Play continues for a previously agreed number of cards, with the question-master role being rotated, and the winner is the one who has won the most cards at the end.

Fire in the Sky provides players with the same problems and perspectives faced by the historical combatants, yet does so in a game that can be played in 5 hours or less. The game is ingeniously balanced and so provides not only a look into the minds of the actual commanders, but also a fun, competitive and tense gaming experience.<br/><br/>The game includes glorious 1-inch counters, a clever map that integrates hexes and areas, and rules that cover all of the essential aspects of the Great Pacific War.

The players take command of the armies of Marlborough, Prince Eugene, Louis XIV, Charles XII of Sweden, Tsar Peter the Great etc. <br/>The game is focused on command and control (or the lack of it in this period). The commander in chief and the wing commanders of the armies have a fixed number of opportunities per turn to try to give orders to units, depending on their abilities. Units without orders act with a kind of artificial intelligence depending on unit type and troop quality. For example, heavy cavalry with good morale will generally charge nearest enemy unit within sight. The presence of retreating or fleeing friendly units increase the chances that a given unit also will retreat/flee etc. Battlefield visibility decrease as the battle proceeds, so commanders and units will have an increasingly harder time to see each other.<br/>Optional figure scales and basing. Each battle have two sides, but several players can easily take the role of a wing commander each.<br/><br/>The rules provide army lists and optional rules that may be used to provide greater detail and a more tactical feel, as desired by the players. A separate, 98-page book on Armies of the War of the Spanish Succession and the Great Northern Wars has been published by the designers giving greatly detailed army lists along with additional new and optional rules.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Quite an ambitious undertaking for one game, yet Commands &amp; Colors by design is a unique historical wargame system which allows players to effectively portray stylized battles from this time in history. The 15 battles, showcased in the scenario booklet, although stylized, focus on important terrain features and the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. The battles include Bagradas, Cannae, and Zama.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The scale of the game fluctuates from battle to battle. For some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent a legion of fighters, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave warriors. But the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various units, their weapons, terrain and time.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Unlike its older brother, Battle Cry by Avalon Hill, Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is moderately more complex and contains additional historical details without the battlefield clutter. Most scenarios will still play to a conclusion in less than an hour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The command card system, drives movement, creates a true fog of war and presents both challenges and opportunities. There are four types of command cards: Leadership cards, Section cards, Troop cards and Tactic cards.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The battle dice system resolves all combat efficiently and quickly. Each battle die has one Light, one Medium, one Heavy, one Leader, one Flag and one Swords symbol.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game mechanics, although simple, will still require strategic card play, historical tactics, timely dice rolling, and an aggressive yet flexible battle plan, to achieve victory.&quot;<br/><br/>",2006,,,

War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.<br/><br/>Rob Markham's Soldier Raj builds on the highly successful model of Soldier Emperor to portray these conflicts. Over a dozen scenarios cover these wars, from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh.

Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice.

14142,Nasenspiel,"['Enclosure', 'Tile Placement']",['Abstract Strategy'],"Players effectively make a large pattern of groups of noses and score points at the end for owning groups. There are 10 noses, all taken from art, shown paired up in every combination on large tiles (excepting one pairing because there are only 54 tiles in the game). The tiles are shuffled face-down and distributed evenly (excess can go in the box). Players then turn up and sort their noses out.<br/><br/>They take it in turns to add a nose to the pattern according to the rules, and when a player makes or increases a group of one type of nose, they place one of their five colored markers on it. (If you happen to increase two groups, you place 2 markers.)<br/><br/>But as soon as another player increases that group, their marker replaces the first, which goes back to the other player. In this way, the pattern gets bigger and players fight to control the noses. But because of the random distribution, you will have some fewer noses than others, so the placement becomes very tactical as you try to close off groups and secure your scoring.<br/><br/>The pattern must sit within a 10x10 grid, and all the tiles are open, so it pays to deliberately extend the grid in one direction, giving or taking away opportunities. When no more tiles can be placed, you score one point for each nose you own.<br/><br/>A surprisingly tricky game given the range of noses, Nasenspiel entertains with a delightful combination of sacrifice and reward and a very unusual theme.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

The games typically used large wooden game boards depicting the playing field and a game matrix of various results. Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column of the matrix to find out what happened.<br/><br/>Computer Sports Games combined five sports titles into one game. In the original 1972 edition, the football field was pre-printed onto a large wooden board. Two double-sided overlays were provided to allow the other sports to be played on the same board. Plastic markers are used to record the position of the ball/puck and show other game stats.<br/><br/>This was followed by the more compact 1974 release. Instead of using the oversized wooden boards characteristic of the original EDC games, this edition uses a smaller plastic board which only displays the game matrix. Two double-sided cardboard overlays contain the matrices for the other sports. The individual playing fields are printed on cardstock panels.<br/><br/>",1972,,,
14191,¥€$,['Dice Rolling'],['Economic'],"&yen;&euro;$ (YES) is a new game produced by Armstrong Company and launched in 2004. There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.<br/><br/>There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.<br/><br/>The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.<br/><br/>Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player. Due to the nature of the dice, the cards, and the rules, it is quite possible for the game to end in the first round. ...or it can go on forever.  [See Fluxx.]<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Movement is determined by a number die.<br/><br/>The players represent reporters, who have to get a theme (on red event spaces)and a buyer (on green buyer spaces). If a player gets a theme he has to create a Headline, while moving his meeple to the buyer space. On arrival at the buyer space he has to present his headline and gets points (chips) awarded. The lenght (number of words) of the headline is determined by the distance between event space and buyer space. Long headlines get more chips than short ones.<br/><br/>The event spaces and buyer spaces are chosen by a funnel action. If a player playes a funnel action he rolls the number die and the letter die to determine coordinates for a section on the game board. In each section there are one or two event spaces, buyer spaces or penality spaces. If any player wants to use a space in the given sector, he throws his pellet into the funnel. The player whose pellet gets into the bottom of the funnel gets to chose one of the available free spaces in this section and puts a task marker on it.

14268,George Washington's Campaigns,"['Action Points', 'Modular Board']","['American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame']","George Washington's Campaigns is a boxed boardgame featuring scenarios for the battles of Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.  A square, heavy cardboard base with raised frame allows specific battlefields to be composed from a set of 144 one-by-one-inch terrain tiles (using the backs for &quot;clear&quot; terrain), producing a square-grid map.  Terrain tile types include hill (white slope splashes on brown), wooded (white outlines of trees on green), swamp (green swamp grass humps on white), river (white waves on blue), fort (white squares on brown), city (white &quot;streets&quot; on brown), objective (star), and combinations of several of these types (such as city streets superimposed on brown-backed hill).<br/><br/>Scenario cards provide a summary of each battle, order of battle for each side, terrain diagram for board set-up, and initial deployment.  Several scenarios have special rules or late-appearing forces.<br/><br/>Combat units are 7/8&quot; square two-sided counters.  Full-strength side is a white silhouette (infantryman, rider, or cannon) on a dark blue (Continental) or bright red (British) background.  Also represented are French (lighter shade of blue) and Hessians (lighter shade of red).  The reverse side of each counter is a national-color silhouette on white, representing a reduced-strength unit.<br/><br/>Units are further differentiated into Regular, Light, and Grenadier Infantry, Artillery, or mounted Dragoons.  The counter mix includes includes eight Continental infantry units (all rated as Light), two Continental Dragoons and two Continental Artillery, plus two French Regulars, one French Light, one French Grenadier, one French Dragoon and one French Artillery.<br/><br/>On the side of the Crown are six British Regular, one British Light, one British Grenadier, two British Dragoon and two British Artillery units, plus two Hessian Regular, one Hessian Light, one Hessian Grenadier, one Hessian Dragoon and one Hessian Artillery.<br/><br/>Most battles feature from seven to ten units on a side.  From battle to battle, unit scale, obviously abstracted, varies from one regiment to a division each.  The overall composition of each army in a scenario, however, strives to represent the historic proportions present at that action.<br/><br/>Unit scale, combined with the grid scale of each battlefield, allows great variety in approach and many options for force allocation and maneuver.<br/><br/>Movement is Igo-Ugo with a twist.  Movement is regulated by the draw of one card each turn by each player.  Cards are pre-cut, about three by two inches, glossy red on the back with a red number on the face.  The number on each card (from one to ten) indicates the total number of movement points that may be expended by the owner's side that turn.  There are a total of forty cards, one for each turn in a scenario.  When the cards are all used, the scenario is ended.<br/><br/>Movement points may be divided among the owning player's units in any manner desired.  One unit might move ten spaces through clear terrain, or multiple units may be moved in any desired order, so long as the maximum number of moves for that turn (defined by the card drawn) is not exceeded.  Friendly units may move through one another, but no stacking is permitted at turn's end.<br/><br/>Rules (which only total four pates) are divided into &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Advanced.&quot;  In the Basic Game, Swamps stop movement and rivers may only be crossed at diagonal bends between river squares (representing &quot;fords&quot; or &quot;bridges&quot;).  No diagonal movement is permitted except for such river crossings.<br/><br/>In the Advanced Game, terrain becomes more restrictive; Artillery, for example, may not enter Forest or Swamp squares.  Dragoons and Light Infantry units may move diagonally--a significant advantage.  Dragoons, if chosen for movement,  may also move two squares for each &quot;turn movement point&quot; allowed on the movement card for that turn.  Advanced Rules also provide for defensive benefits in fort, city or hill terrain, a quality advantage for Grenadiers, new rules for retreats, and Bayonet Attacks--costly but devastating if successful.<br/><br/>Units adjacent to enemy units at turn's end will receive defensive fire (roll one or two on a D6 for a hit).  Units are flipped on the first hit, eliminated on the second.  Attacking units which receive a first hit are retreated one space.  Surviving friendly units will then attack an adjacent enemy unit by the same method.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by points scored.  Two points are scored for each &quot;objective square&quot; occupied by a friendly unit at game's end, and one point for each enemy unit eliminated.  Given the area represented by each battlefield map, players usually have a choice between driving for geographical objectives and destroying enemy forces.  However, troop resources are finite and a reverse often compels a change in plan.<br/><br/>Although &quot;George Washington's Campaigns&quot; might more accurately be titled &quot;Battles of George Washington,&quot; a campaign game rule provides for a victory based on accrued points from multiple battle scenarios.  Since each scenario plays fast--rarely more than an hour--this is a viable approach to the game.<br/><br/>The game is free of ambiguity and errors, provides a fine vehicle for introducing new gamers to the hobby, and provides a fast but entertaining and balanced puzzle for the more experienced.  Almost thirty years later, it is notable for its clean rules, accessibility, and replayability.  Until the recent appearance of Decision Games' American Revolution series, it also provided the only published Long Island scenario in the gaming world.<br/><br/>This game was evidently produced with the U.S. Bicentennial (1976).  The number of copies printed is unknown; this game was found in the early 1980's at a shop in Alexandria, Va.  The box is approximately 16 x 14 by 1 1/2 inches in size, white background with a large blue drawing of Washington and his staff mounted on a hil, with red, white and blue letters in the lower right proclaiming the title.  Included is a cardboard insert providing a tray for pieces and printed examples of play.<br/><br/>",1976,,,

14309,Chamelequin,['Pattern Building'],['Abstract Strategy'],"From Dave Farquhar's Review:<br/><br/>Chamelequin is described on the box as 'a game of skill and ever changing colours'; a reasonably accurate summary. The board is a striking 8x8 grid of large coloured squares. These alternate, with one row being green and yellow, the next red and blue. The effect of this was illustrated by Alastair (age 1) sobbing his heart out when I wouldn't let him play on it. The plastic pieces comprise circular bases, from which a stem protrudes, and large numbers of coloured 'polo shaped' rings. The object of the game is to be the survivor.<br/><br/>The initial set up is achieved by the players alternately placing one of their pieces on the board, at the same time dropping a coloured ring onto the stem. The basic principle is that the uppermost ring will always be the same colour as the square the piece occupies. This continues until all have been placed; ten each if two player, otherwise eight.<br/><br/>Player turns then continue, with one piece being moved each turn. This may be done in one of two ways: by moving one square and adding a ring or by removing rings and moving up to three squares. The former option is the standard move, and in this way stacks of up to four rings may be built up. Each time the colour ring selected matches the square moved to. The latter option is generally an attacking move. The top ring is removed, and the ring thus revealed shows the colour square which is then moved to. This process may be continued, until only one is left, at which point the move must stop as the last ring may never be removed. Any enemy pieces encountered during this move are eliminated from play. It is theoretically possible to capture three enemy pieces in one turn.<br/><br/>",1989,,,

There are 32 Suspect cards which show pictures like those on the outside of the box - the suspect is always the same man (Robert de Niro look-a-like) but could be wearing one of four different hats, sunglasses or not, and one of four differently-colored sweaters. There are also 32 Mr. Who cards which have written descriptions that match the Suspect cards, but with the characteristics in random order. In each round, one player is Mr. Who and picks a Mr. Who card - the other players are detectives and try to deduce which suspect he is. They play cards to the grid on the board to get information on the three items on the Mr. Who card. During this process Mr. Who commits more crimes and the reward money increases. After everyone has been Mr. Who once the player with the most money wins.<br/>The board is made of vinyl. A little metal car is used to track Mr. Who's progress.

Each player must setup the best fitting victory conditions for their places and heroes in their own game-sets themselves.<br/><br/>Success and failure in W97 is determined by a well put together game-set, the strategy of the player and the overall luck of dice rolls.<br/><br/>New players will find an easy and fast introduction into W97 through the basic set, which comes with pre-configured, presorted strips for two players.

14404,Spillet om lokomotivet Thomas,"['Dice Rolling', 'Roll / Spin and Move']","[""Children's Game"", 'Movies / TV / Radio theme', 'Novel-based', 'Trains']","From a review by Charles Vasey:<br/><br/>Intended for Ages 5 - 11<br/><br/>The game is played on a board about a foot square. The four engines start at the sheds and must get to the station around the various lines and branch lines. There are three principle junctions and here may stand (in imposing black) the ample figure of The Fat Controller (the worthy Sir Topham Hatt). Engines may not go down the line blocked by The Fat Controller. However, a player whose engine lands on a yellow space (of which there are a number) must move The Fat Controller to another junction. Coming at a strategic moment this can send one's opponents off around a loop-line. There are also a number of spaces with special effects; 'Throw Again' and (very popular this one) 'Send any engine back to shed' are examples. Movement is regulated by a dice roll. Engines may pass each other but may not occupy the same space.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly a popular feature of Thomas the Tank Engine is the four little engine models executed in excellent detail in the predominant colour. The wheel arrangements are correct although it must be remarked that James The Red Engine (who is, you will remember, a Mixed Goods engine) lacks his tender. The four engines provided are Thomas, Percy, James and Toby, and the only complaint among my nephews was that there was no Gordon, Henry or Edward (I'm a Troublesome Truck man myself). Naturally I had to point out that the game board dipslayed Thomas' branch line, not the main line where extremely important engines would operate. I felt there was a ground swell here for an expansion kit.<br/><br/>Among its intended market the game is a great success but it is too simple other than for tinkering with by older gamers. Although, having said that, I have noticed it is a popular game for visitors to take down and play about with.<br/><br/>",1986,,,
14405,Dail Eireann,"['Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling']",['Political'],"A self-published game that shares components with Aras An Uachtaran, with both games being themed to Irish politics.<br/><br/>From a review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:<br/><br/>This is a 4 hour game, with each player taking the part of one of the groupings in the Irish parliament. Play is split into 15 rounds, in each of which players campaign and fight elections. Seats won translate into victory points (necessary, because this is a game in which the parties are not of equal strength and so each has its own conversion rate), and at the end the player with the highest number of victory points wins. Each party has a percentage share of the vote. At the start these range from 44 for Fianna Fail down to 3 for the Independents, but these will fluctuate during the game as a result of electoral successes and failures and the campaigning attentions of one's opponents. Each 5 per cent, or part thereof, that you have at the start of a round entitles you either to draw a constituency card or to place a marker on the board. Owning a constituency card enables you to decide when the election will be called for the seat, and having a marker in the constituency is necessary if you are to take part when it is.<br/><br/>An election can not be called if a constituency contains fewer than 3 markers. Markers once played can be moved, and there is a limit to the number of markers that can be in a constituency at any one time (with a Civilization-style combat mechanism for removing any surplus). All of which makes for a lot of tactical jostling. When an election is called, players with markers in the constituency collect votes equal to 1d6 plus the number of their markers. An overall majority is needed for victory, and votes of less successful candidates are reallocated until this is achieved. Reallocation is done using a preference list mechanism, which again offers a lot of scope for tactical maneuver.<br/><br/>",1997,,,
14406,Aras An Uachtaran,"['Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Set Collection']",['Political'],"A self-published game that shares components with Dail Eireann, with both games being themed to Irish politics.<br/><br/>From the review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:<br/><br/>Each player is a presidential candidate, with a playing piece that moves around the map picking up votes. Movement is by die roll. My first reaction when we started to play was that there was really nothing much to the game, but by the time we were a third of the way through, everyone was clearly having to think, I was enjoying myself and my opinion had been changed.<br/><br/>Three constituency cards are dealt face up by the board. The first candidate to visit the constituency collects the card and replaces it with another one from the deck. The object is to collect as many cards as you can and eventually an overall majority. Very much at the ``6 and up level so far. The fun again comes with the markers. When you collect a card you place one of your markers in the constituency, and on a turn when you fail to pick up a card you place one in a constituency of your choice. The effect of these is to slow down the movement of your rivals. The basic cost to move from one constituency to the next is one point from the die roll, but if you are trying to move into a constituency where some other player has more markers than you, you increase the cost by the number of markers you are behind the constituency leader.<br/><br/>So what starts as a level field soon develops some very adverse gradients, and regional fiefdoms begin to appear. If this were the only effect the markers had, the game would still be fairly straightforward, but it isn't. Once again, this is an Irish election, and a simple majority is not enough to become president; you need an overall one. So after all the cards have been picked up and a pecking order established on the first count, votes start being transferred. When a candidate is eliminated, the votes they had switch over on a constituency by constituency basis, going to whichever still active candidate has most markers in the constituency. The effect of this is that in the later stages of the game proper you have to start making choices. Do you place markers so as to impede your rivals, or do you start planning for the count? And if the latter, whose switches do you aim for? What looked easy at the start isn't any longer.<br/><br/>",1997,,,
14407,Fastcard Soccer,"['Area Movement', 'Hand Management']",['Sports'],"A representative of the 'replay' subgenre. Players run through a game of soccer using a deck of cards and a board, but have no actual control over the events in the basic game (though official variants included in the rule book *do* allow for choices on things like substitutions, making this a game)<br/><br/>From the review by Mike Siggins:<br/><br/>Ellis Simpson has been working on a soccer replay game for almost as long as I've known him. I think, having been privy to certain stages of its development, that the turning point came two years ago and Fastcard Soccer is the outcome. The resulting design emphasizes fast play (an admirable and difficult target), yet manages to retain many of the detailed trappings and flavour so important to the soccer fan. Well, this soccer game fan anyway. Like most replay games it is best enjoyed solitaire, but I have played some two-legged matches recently with a friend and these worked well enough. By way of a caution, please bear in mind throughout this review, as with Final Score, that I know next to nothing about football. What I feel I can comment upon is the atmosphere and game content of the system, and these are both first rate.<br/><br/>The system uses, predictably, a fast action card system that generates almost all of the action. Reference to charts is needed for goal attempts or unusual results (the infamous Z card effects) and the game status levels, essentially the team's overall ratings, are tracked on the pitch display using counters. The rest is a matter of choosing which teams you want to pair off, logging their ratings on the display, and playing the game.<br/><br/>The central structure, to a lazy bugger like me, seems like simplicity itself. Teams are rated for attack, defence and midfield. The latter ratings are compared to see which team wins possession and mounts an attack. A letter is read off, referenced to produce an attack number and then compared to the defence rating; if it is higher, the attack proceeds, if it is lower the attack breaks up, if equal there has been a clearance but the attacker retains possession. The whole setup runs on the highlight system by which, after each complete passage of play, a random number of minutes are marked off on the time display and the game runs through to 90 minutes, or longer if extra time is applicable. This method is now well established and it is an ingenious way of making sure that some ties have a lot of action and chances while other games are much like Arsenal at home to Arsenal. Game length will vary because of the use of highlights, but should take no more than a few minutes per match and it will get quicker as you become familiar with the card turning.<br/><br/>The big selling point for me is that the game features a commentary system that runs straight off the Fastcards themselves. As the attack builds up, you read a comment off the card that may go something like 'A flurry of passes wins a corner; a dipping cross into the box....'. The next card is flipped to reveal, say, 'A header from the back of the six yard box'. The header may go towards the corner of the goal, only to be saved spectacularly or any number of other possibilities. I may be a sucker for atmosphere, but at the speed this all runs (once you are used to the mechanics), it really conjures up the images for me. It is very much like watching the league goals on Match of the Day. Oddly, given one of my criticisms of Final Score, the speedy handling of this seems to negate the problem of not knowing who is on the ball. You can readily work out who has the goal attempt, but it doesn't seem to matter as much who brings the ball upfield.<br/><br/>The slight problem, and the only one in the game really, is that occasionally the commentary pairs don't seem to match up. Although this hasn't yet happened to me in about twenty games, other reviewers have mentioned it and I have seen it happen in the flesh. You might for instance get a header straight at the keeper, only to find him diving to get his fingertips to it. In this instance you can perhaps explain it away by a deflection or perhaps going the wrong way, but it does grate a little even for a man used to rationalising the weirdest German game systems. I can understand why this wasn't picked up (because of the large number of possible outcomes), but it must feel a little odd when it happens.<br/><br/>",1992,,,

Players must protect their areas from the rampaging monster by deploying units of the national guard while at the same time evacuating tasty populace units.  As key production units in each sector are destroyed by Godran, the players&rsquo; resources dwindle.  Perhaps only a hastily-developed super weapon can save the day!<br/><br/>Players have many options in &ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo.&rdquo;  Each turn, their remaining production centers generate a number of &ldquo;Mega-Yen&rdquo; to be spent in a variety of ways.  First, players bid &ldquo;Mega-Yen&rdquo; to control Godran.  Each turn, Godran could be controlled by a different player.  Victory point incentives will keep Godran rampaging - but if you win the bidding, Godran will rampage someplace other than your back yard!<br/><br/>Mega-Yen can also be used to activate defense units, to evacuate panicked yet recalcitrant citizenry, and to develop super weapons to combat the mighty Godran.  Jury-rig a Death Ray and hope for a quick knockout punch, or undertake the longer and more expensive, but more sure-fire, process of researching Godran&rsquo;s origins to find his weakness. The Mega-Yen is an imaginary currency whose value, for the purposes of this game, is ridiculously high.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; plays essentially the same with two, three or four players.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; (Also known as ON,TGT!) contains a fold-out map that represents a hypothetical section of downtown Tokyo.

The game includes a set of counters representing Godran, destroyed buildings, the national guard in four colors and populace units in four colors.  Also included are a small selection of cards -  representing potential origin points for Godran and hair brained schemes to control the beast.  Relevant charts are included in the back of the rules for ease of access.  Play requires the use of multiple six sided dice to resolve combat and scrap paper for record keeping.<br/><br/>",2002,,,

Every Man to his Station has a moral theme illustrated with scenes from everyday country life. There are severe penalties imposed for bad behavior, notably being sent to the House of Correction, and for such misdemeanors as slothful behavior and theft. Rewards are given for charity, hardship, poverty and modesty. The instructions are charmingly written in rhyming verse and explore early nineteenth century life from the perspective of its morality ad social structures. Every Man to his Station is one of a set of collectible early nineteenth century boardgames from the archives of the Victoria and Albert museum, and this game is licensed 1994 for publication by the board of trustees of the V&amp;A, published by the Historical Games Company, and is an exact duplication of one of the original surviving 1825 games on display at the museum.

Pieces may not be placed such that they force an immediate capture unless there is already a capture threat elsewhere or there is no choice but to place a piece in jeopardy. The last player places all of his/her remaining pieces on the board at once in one tall &quot;shadow&quot; piece. Players control stacks when their piece is on top. In the movement &amp; capture phase, players move one piece one square at a time to the next square (only on the black squares -- connectivity is four) or capture (mandatory when possible) the top piece of a stack under the bottom of another stack by jumping over it.

When Napoleon marched on Paris, Murat attacked the Austrians in Central Italy. He was defeated in the battle of Tolentino on 2 May. He escaped to France, but Napoleon did not want his services.

In the first half of the twentieth century, world chess champion Jose Raul Capablanca (1888-1942) apparently improved on Bird's variant by rearranging the order of the major pieces. This variant became known as Capablanca Chess.

14448,Immortals of Change,[],"['Action / Dexterity', 'Science Fiction']","The follow up to Lakeside's action-strategy game Crossbows and Catapults, Immortals of Change takes the same basic gameplay and puts a futuristic twist on it. The object of the game is the same: players take turns using weapons (both &quot;pivoting&quot; and &quot;forward firing&quot;, which amount to high-tech catapults and crossbows, respectively) to shoot projectiles at their opponent's forces. The prime target for these projectiles (and they are quite literally shot, using rubber-band powered mechanisms) are the five boundary sensors, which hide behind and around Protective Barriers and Battle Fortresses. The first to destroy all five wins.<br/><br/>However, unlike Crossbows and Catapults, the weapons in Immortals of Change can be built into different configurations. While additional combinations are possible, the base Battle Set promotes five different official combinations: Battle Falcon, Bull Rover, Big Strut, Battle Creeper, and Robot. Each combination has both strengths and weaknesses. Additional expansion sets allow even more formations, objectives, and scenarios.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>In a different time, enemy warriors will do battle using strange and menacing weapons. You are the commander of your forces, your opponent, the commander of his. Both commanders have great arsenals of weapons that convert from offensive to defensive weapons as the tides of battle change.

In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Players start off following some &quot;initial rule set&quot;, and gameplay occurs in clockwise order, with each player taking a turn. In that turn, they propose a change in rules that all the other players vote on, and then roll a die to determine the number of points they add to their score. If this rule change is passed, it comes into effect at the end of their round. Any rule can be changed with varying degrees of difficulty, including the core rules of the game itself. As such, the gameplay may quickly change.<br/><br/>Rules are divided up into two types: mutable and immutable. The main difference between these is that immutable rules must be changed into mutable rules (called transmuting) before they can be modified or removed. Immutable rules also take precedence over mutable ones. A rule change may be:<br/><br/><br/>     the addition of a new mutable rule<br/>     an amendment to a mutable rule<br/>     the repeal of a mutable rule<br/>     the transmutation of a rule from mutable to immutable<br/>     or the transmutation of a rule from immutable to mutable<br/><br/><br/>The game can be played around a table with written notes, or online through mailing lists or forums. Alternative starting rulesets exist, particularly for online and postal games which don't suit the usual clockwise turn order. Several games have been running online for over a decade.<br/><br/>",1982,,,

The three all better cards show the same three body parts but the character is smiling and healthy. Typically, a game involves spinning a spinner that selects a character, flipping up an All Better card in hopes of finding a card for that character, and (if a match is made) placing the All Better card over the corresponding Aches and Pains card to heal the character.

There is a treasure chest in the center and 4 'betting corners' - one with a picture of a pistol, another with a picture of a cannon, another a trumpet and the last a sword. The chips come in white (worth 1 pt.), black (2 pts.) and gold (3 pts.).

Before each player's turn, all players place 1 chip (value 1) on each betting corner. Player keeps rolling until she wins chips or passes. On your turn: Roll the dice. If all three are treasure chests, take all chips on the treasure chest. (This only applies to 3 treasure chests thrown on the first roll.) If all three are the same betting item, take all chips from the corresponding betting corner and your turn is over. If the roll has different betting items, you can set aside one kind and re-roll the rest. You must put one chip (value 1) on each betting corner that corresponds to the face of a die you will re-roll. (ex: You roll a cannon, a sword and a trumpet. You choose to keep the sword, pay 1 pt to the cannon corner, pay 1 pt to the trumpet corner and re-roll.) As long as you don't win, you can continue to pay 1 point to the appropriate corner(s) for each die re-rolled. Once you have three of the same betting item, take all chips on that item and your turn is over. For each treasure chest rolled, every player (including you) puts 1 point on the treasure chest.

Bidding is normal except that the players can see all the cards in both their hands. The only other difference is that the declarer does not lay down his dummy's cards but shows them one at a time per trick: otherwise three entire hands would be exposed to the declarer's opponent (and thus make the game pointless).<br/><br/>The game is helpful for beginners trying to get a grasp of the bidding process, but also fun for experts who want to calculate their bids with full knowledge of two hands.<br/><br/>",1967,,,

For example, if the player batting presses the #2 button, and the player in the field presses the #4 button, the Strike lamp would light up, while a combination of #6 and #4 would result in the triple lamp lighting. Each player also has A and B switches that are pressed to light the Safe or Out lamps needed for the results of some plays (like if a runner tries to steal 2nd base). Wooden cubes are used to represent base runners. The player with the most runs scored at the end of 9 innings wins. Extra innings are played if needed.<br/><br/>History:<br/><br/>An application for a U.S. patent was filed in December 1927 by James M. Prentice of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Prentice was 17 years old.

Discs count as either other type; a valid row contains either rings and/or disks OR nubs and/or disks.  It is allowed to place, for instance, your nub into an opponent's ring (quiet, you!).

The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Given the right deployments and forces, the inability to take advantage of the marvelous abilities of the vaunted knights, the finest mounted force in Europe, became something of a surprise to many &quot;experts.&quot;<br/><br/>Men of Iron is designed for quick learning and easy play.

The rules are very accessible and the possibilities are multiple.<br/><br/>The game takes place in Britain, around the 9th century. Each player represents one people fighting for occupying space and developing their civilization.<br/><br/>To gain victory points you must build temples and cities. For that, it is necessary to generate resources that come from the conquest of new territories and from the founding of new cities. And to conquer new territories you must also build troops and buy cards.<br/><br/>The troops move through the territories and also by ship, which gives them more mobility. The battles are fought with dice, affected by cards played with the face down and revealed at the same time. The presence of a leader also affects the result.<br/><br/>The end of each round is marked by a Viking attack, the Vikings being the most feared warriors of that time and of the game. After that, there comes the scoring and each player receives victory points markers that he hides from the other players.<br/><br/>At the end of 8 rounds, the player with more points wins the game.<br/><br/>The challenge is to balance economic and military development, aiming at gaining the most victory points.<br/><br/>From the instructions:<br/>For 2 to 5 players ages 9 and up.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

Where Everyone Plays all the Time.&quot;<br/><br/>The game consists of an 8 second sand timer and 200 oversize cards each depicting either the top half or the bottom half of a colorful and humorous cartoon animal (such as Titus the skateboard riding elephant, Dolly the hula dancing penguin, or Howie the hockey playing monkey).  Play progresses as each player in turn draws a card from the shuffled deck and places it in plain view on the table. The player who's turn it is then has 8 seconds to find a matching pair of cards anywhere on the table and yell &quot;Connexus&quot; before play moves on to the next player.  But there's a catch!  Not every matching pair of cards will correctly fit together, as each card has either a tab or a slot on the edge where the two cards join.  For a match to count, one card must have a tab and the other a slot.    Legal matches are immediately removed from the board, however, mistakenly yelling &quot;Connexus&quot; without being able to make a match causes the player to forfeit one previously completed match.  Gameplay continues until one player has reached a predetermined number of matches.<br/><br/>The fast pace and the challenge of seeing and remembering all the cards and being able to locate them quickly enough to ensure that a potential matching pair will fit together are what make this game so exiting for all players involved.  Players must constantly be aware of their own cards as well as the other players' cards at all times in order to make matches.<br/><br/>I believe only a few proof of concept prototypes of this game were ever published which is a real shame because this game is one that can truly be enjoyed and played competitively by players of any age.<br/><br/>",1999,,,

Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.<br/><br/>As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.<br/><br/>The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.<br/><br/>The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.<br/><br/>So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from Compass Games website:)Components:<br/>    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map<br/>    132 counters<br/>    1 deck of 55 playing cards<br/>    2 player-aid cards<br/>    1 rules booklet<br/>    2 6-sided dice<br/>    1 full color box and lid<br/><br/>",2008,,,

At any time, players may request that the Reader read all the clues already chosen.<br/><br/>Scoring: <br/>Each 20 Questions card has a value of 20 points.

After the free guess, the same player chooses another number, listens to the clue, and guesses again.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Bonus Round: <br/>Any time that players end their move on a Bonus Space they may play a Bonus Round.  To play a Bonus Round, the Reader chooses a card from the deck and identifies it as a Person, Place, Thing or Year.

When a development is completed, the rules allow the acting player to swap markers with those of other players in adjacent spaces, subject to certain limitations, thus expanding his control over the local area.

Players earn chips by answering questions in three categories--History, EST, and Trivia.  It's also possible to earn medals and promotions by landing on certain spaces, which are also worth chips.  Players must attempt to reach the star in the center of the board.  Of those who reach it, the player with the most chips is the winner.

Some spaces on the board have special instructions that must be followed (lose a turn, move ahead two, that sort of thing.)

Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.<br/><br/>On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by &quot;turn tokens&quot; that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.<br/><br/>Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.<br/><br/>No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, returning to your pile of pieces (your &quot;village&quot;) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.<br/><br/>There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the &quot;Accoutrements of Kingship&quot; instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to &quot;buy the kingship&quot;. Tokens are included for these variants.<br/><br/>The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.<br/><br/>",2005,,,

14827,Bir Buyuk Turk Saldiri,"['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']","['Print & Play', 'Wargame', 'World War I']","Bir Buyuk Turk Saldiri (The Great Turk Attack) covers the climatic end of the Asia Minor War that began in 1919. By 1922, the British, French and Italians had long abandoned the Greek Army's occupation of some 400 km in Turkey. Originally planned to recover the spoils of WW1 when Turkey surrendered, the Allied powers had promised Greece a part of Turkey, which the Greeks claimed was part of &quot;Greater Greece&quot;. The Greeks by the Summer of 1921, had advanced to within 30 km of Ankara, there the critical battle of the Sakarya River ended the advance. The failure of the battle now turned public opinion at home and amongst troops in Turkey against the war. From 1921 to 1922, the Greek Asia Minor Army held a 400 km front line. The Greeks were hoping and desperately looking for a honorable way out of the mess that the British had got them in. Greece was going broke because of the war and depended on England to provide monetary loans. Greek morale wavered.<br/><br/>The Turks under Mustapha Kemal (Ataturk) were about to give a good reason for the Greeks to leave.<br/><br/>The game is operational, 2 miles a hex, battalions and regiments. In all, 280 counters and 11x17 inch color map. Units have two combat strengths and there are two movement phases. Reserves are important. Supply is critical. Units include infantry, cavalry, artillery, aircraft and HQ's. Each turn is 12 hrs. There are two games, the campaign from August 26 to 31st and &quot;The Pocket&quot;, where five Greek divisions are trapped from August 29-31. The game is not complex and can be completed in two hours.<br/><br/>Related game:<br/>Bloodbath at the Sakarya, August, 1921<br/><br/>",2004,,,
14828,Operation Eisbär,['Hexagon Grid'],"['Wargame', 'World War II']","As the tide of WW2 began to sway in favor Allies in the Fall of 1943 with the Italian sudden surrender, the British began to pursue their peripheral strategy, linked with expansionist aims in the Balkans. However, oddly enough, they would not sanction adequate ground, sea and air forces to mount it. The British however, possibly because the capture of the Dodecanese had been one of Churchill's favorite projects ever since war began, plunged in hell or high water, ignoring the fact that boldness does not always equate to success. <br/>Kos, even today, remains a quaint island unchanged in many ways since 1943. Located in the Aegean Sea, four miles from the Turkish coast is 28 miles long and 6 miles wide, at the widest point. It has an area of about 115 square miles, and a population of 20,000 in 1943, an airfield at Marmari, near the coast, another at Antimachia, and an emergency landing ground under construction at Lambia, near the town of Kos. The highest elevation is 2800 feet. Because of the airfields and its small port, Kos was one key, which would unlock the Aegean. If it could be taken, argued the British, Rhodes would fall and with Rhodes in British control, the other islands garrisoned with Italians, would certainly surrender. The other Allies, the Americans, were not interested in the least and refused to even lend a few P-38 squadrons until too late.<br/><br/>Thus, the British were on their own to pursue what Churchill had wanted: the soft underbelly of Europe.<br/><br/>OPERATION EISBAR was the German operation, a prelude to Leros, to prevent the British the most important first step: Kos. The game is a unique blend that allows for either player to win. The first step for the Germans is to destroy the three Spitfire squadrons based on Kos. Only when this is accomplished can German forces invade the island or drop their paratroopers. For the British, if they can cause sufficient aircraft losses during the first phase (German air raids), they may persuade them not to invade Kos. Failing this, the British Kos garrison with one battalion must prevent the Germans from either landing or if they land, defeat them on shore. British BB, CV or DD's may suddenly appear causing havoc, yet, become targets for the Luftwaffe. British Beaufighters may also suddenly appear during an air raid or invasion and torpedo the German ships. The Random Events will make each game's outcome totally different. Above all else, the British must fly in their supplies using only eight DC3s during the first phase.<br/><br/>The game's scale is platoons and company sized units, individual ships, each air counter is four aircraft. Each hex is 800 yards, game turns are 3-4 hours. The game lasts from Sept 17 to Oct 4. While the number of turns appears a lot, in reality, during Phase 1 (from Sept 17-Oct 2) turns move rapidly as only air battles and bombing occurs. Each player plans which map zone to defend and attack and what time!<br/><br/>The game map is divided into area zones and used to determine which areas of the island will be targeted by the German, defended by the British. They also serve for placement of British Naval and off map based aircraft which may randomly appear! There 280 counters.<br/><br/>",2004,,,

A collection of polyglot men with dubious training and questionable morale. Some 60,000 of them. Time was running out as the Fall weather set in, both sides knew it. Lenin and Trotsky began the ultimate propaganda campaign to stir the emotions of the peasant workers. Free food and clothing was the lure to fight. Thousands enlisted.

It was Syria's Kursk-like battle. Over 100 T-62 and T-55 tanks faced a paltry 20 IDF Centurion tanks, many short of ammunition. It was David vs. Goliath in modern day terms. The only thing the IDF had going for it was the 12 foot deep anti-tank ditch and the three tiered ramp positions for the tanks. The Valley of Tears remains perfect tank country, flat with long range of fire. To add to the confusion, the IDF patch quilt of forces all operated on different radio frequencies making any coordination impossible.

Over 2000 Russians and 800 Chechens would lose their lives there. The urban setting littered with many brick and stone buildings with deep basements made for a bloody fight. On March 5th, the Chechen forces seized the town from the Russians and held on until the 15th. Every building would be a war. The Russians pounded the town with artillery, air and Mi-24 gunships creating simply more and more rubble. More Chechens arrived and by the 9th, some 1500 were in the town. Each basement had become a bunker. Russian elite troops were sent in, including Russia's recent new air-fuel weapon, the dreaded Buratino and Schmel. T-72's were sent in firing at point blank range towards the buildings. It was a messy battle and both sides were determined to win and the Russians had just been obliterated near Ulus-Kert on Hill 776 losing its whole 6th Paratroop company!<br/><br/>Depicts what many call the most devastating battle after Grozny.

Taking advantage of the situation, the 500 man force attacked the town and wiped out the Russians. Beginning on the 6th, the Russian military made six attempts to seize the town, all failed. Artillery, airstrikes, T-72 tanks and Buratino's were called in. It was a sledgehammer. The Chechen force withstood this using underground pillboxes in the stone buildings, and by the 12th, the town was in ruin and the Russians still remained along the perimeter.

Beyond the Urals postulates that the Germans had defeated the Red Army in their 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, but failed to force the capitulation of the Soviet Union itself. In early 1941, Soviet leaders had decided to deploy their armed forces &quot;up front&quot; on the border with the Third Reich, as chief of the Red Army armored forces, General D.G. Pavlov, had proposed. As a result of this alternative deployment, the Germans destroy the Red Army on the frontiers, sweep eastwards, and take Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad in late 1941.<br/><br/>However, in this alternative time-line, the Soviets keep fighting even after the Germans reached their planned Archangel-Astrakhan stop line. Being given no alternatives other than to suffer the consequences of German exploitation and terror in the East, or to continue a desperate resistance, the Russians and other Soviet peoples go on fighting. The remnants of the Red Army make their stand to protect the great industrial complexes east of the Urals, hoping to draw in the Germans for the final decisive battle. As 1942 opens, Hitler orders the Wehrmacht to head into the East for the final battle of annihilation in Eurasia, beyond the Urals.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 7 days<br/>Hex: 20 miles / 32.4 kilometers<br/>Units: Corps to Armies<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Beyond the Urals rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 5-10 hours<br/><br/>Note: One 6-sided die is needed for play<br/><br/>",2002,,,

There are resource generating squares, mystical sites and castles.  Players must manage these resources an fight battles to become the king of all England.

By obtaining a matching GRAPE and WINE label, and buying a LICENSE, the player can then produce that wine, which earns them money.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to establish monopolies - there are only 2 WINES for each region, and if the player can produce both, they own that region. Target for a short game (90 minutes) is 3 monopolies, while a normal game (2-3 hours) is 6 monopolies.<br/><br/>This is not a simple roll and move game, as there is a certain amount of economics in the game - the value of everybody's wine is dependent on the VINTAGE, which changes periodically.<br/><br/>There is no need to have a knowledge of wine, as the information on what grape makes what wine is provided on the cards.

The game comes with a booklet about the historical battle, and an album with glue-in images from the film Hannibal (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1959).<br/>It has very simple rules: the units can move one to three spaces and battles are resolved by simple dice rolls, modified by strength of the units (elephant!, cavalry) and area bonus. Units have something like a zone of control.<br/>The aim is to kill the opponent's leader or to capture the opponents &quot;flag-space&quot;.<br/>What makes this game really interesting are the beautiful hand-painted miniatures. In the original version by Rojas y Malaret, the figures were made of plastic and hand painted. In the German version everything is the same (rules, board, box), but the figures are made of Elastolin, a material invented by the Hausser company a few years earlier and used for toys (they are also hand-painted). Hausser used its own miniatures (diferent and a bit smaller (=4 cm) than the Spanish ones), but the elephant comes from the Rojas y Malaret game &quot;Carthago&quot; (Hausser had no elephant in its catalogue). That's why the elephant miniature in the Hausser version is a bit different in scale and material from the other units (and equal to the original Spanish one).<br/>The Rojas y Malaret version was published in Spain in 1961, and the German version by Hausser in 1963 but it was republished for years.<br/><br/>",1961,,,

Obviously, it can't cover a lot of things, but if you want more detail, get a regular wargame of some sort.<br/><br/>Basically handfuls of dice of different numbers of sides represent different size units on a battlefield.  Different 'fronts' can be declared.  ROtGB uses the Button Men mechanics renamed as 'Direct Assault', where the value on a single attacker die is equal to or greater than the value on a defender die and 'Flanking Maneuver', where multiple attacker dice add up to exactly one defender die (one of the flanking dice must be at least half the value of the defender die to keep a horde of d1's form overcoming it.)<br/><br/>Both players roll at the same time (identifiable dice or seperate rolling areas help.) Players take turns attacking.  After successfully attacking (wherein the defender die is removed from play and the attacker scores the number of sides,) the attacking dice are re-rolled.<br/><br/>A fun way to use a big dice collection.  Advanced rules liek Terrain and Reinforcements round out the game.  Scenarios for medieval and space combat are there as well.<br/><br/>Simple, fast and fun!<br/><br/>",0,,,
