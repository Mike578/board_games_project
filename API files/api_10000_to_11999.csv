Players take turns asking each other for cards matching the ones in their hands, each card being named after a particular fish (or fish-related being, such as Atlantean Priests or Mermaids). When a player manages to get a pair, they place it face-up on the table in front of them, just like in Go Fish. Once the cards hit the table, the Magic: the Gathering aspects come into play, as most of the fish have unique powers that can be used to aid you or annoy your opponents. There are also unique cards (with names like &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Offshore Oil Rig&quot;), which have more esoteric powers and move from player to player as they get used. When one player runs out of cards in their hand, everyone scores a point for each pair they possess, and a new hand is dealt until every player has dealt once, at which point the final scores are tallied and a winner is declared. (Game time is thus dependant on number of players -- my guess of 90 minutes is a rough estimate of a 6-player game, which may not be at all accurate.)<br/><br/>In many ways, Leviathan epitomizes the &quot;beer-and-pretzels&quot; game -- in fact, it was designed in a coffee shop, out of a need for something to do while sitting in a coffee shop. The rules encourage a light (&quot;jovially rude&quot;) atmosphere, and the writing style generally reflects this, although careful attention has been paid to the way the various cards interact, and to fix any possible contradictions or loopholes.

Like many ancient abstract strategy games, the number of pieces and their starting positions varies from region to region but the general play of the game is the same: one player controls a single piece, the fox, the other player controls the geese (usually 13 to 17).  The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.<br/><br/>The game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox &amp; Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Asalto = Siege.<br/><br/>There are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.  There are also several contemporary games using the Halatafl name, at least one of which is played on a similar board to Fox and Geese but with differing rules.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=""""https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer noopener"""">https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2</a> ( CC Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 )<br/><a target='_blank' href=""""http://vimeo.com/51819749"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer noopener"""">http://vimeo.com/51819749</a><br/><br/>"",1400,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many people sought a solution to their problems through simplistic &lsquo;set the world right in ten lessons&rsquo; schemes such as the Technocracy or Social Credit movements, but others put their trust in radical political movements of the far left and right such as the German-American Bund organization, the Wobblies, and the Communist Party.

"10314,Turning Point,""['Enclosure', 'Tile Placement']"",['Abstract Strategy'],""Players sit on opposite sides of the playing board, with scoring columns in the lower right corner. Each player takes 27 regular chips (one will use the pink side while the other will use the orange side), 2 double chips and 1 stop chip. Each player puts all his chips into the holder and takes 3 scoring pegs in his color. The scoring pegs allow tracking scores from zero to 999.<br/><br/>To begin the game, players alternate putting one chip of their color into any of the 4 center holes of the board until all 4 holes are filled. The first player then puts one chip on the board so his chip traps one of his opponent's chips. Trapping is custodial, as in Hnefetafl or Othello/Reversi, in any of the eight directions from the just-placed chip. Once a player traps an opponent's chip, he turns it over to his own color. Players score 1 point for each chip in the new row which has been formed (including the just-played chip and the own-color cap chips). Players may trap multiple chips at once or chips in multiple rows.<br/><br/>Once a double chip is on the board, any row which contains it is worth double (for either player). If there are multiple double chips involved, they're added together before applying the multiplication (thus 3 double chips is sextuple score, 4 double chips is octuple score).<br/><br/>If an opponent turns over a player's stop chip, this prevents the trapped chips in that row from turning over and voids the opponent's score for that row.<br/><br/>The game ends when all holes on the board are filled.

Players compete against one and other to solve the clues which will allow them a try at the word puzzle board. The tension and excitement builds as players race to be the first to figure out the clues and solve the word puzzle, but beware of the stinger. With one sting you can lose a valuable, and possibly, a game winning turn. So gather your family and friends around and enjoy the newest and exciting game you will ever play.<br/><br/>User review:<br/><br/>The game is played by two players or teams while one additional player acts as gamemaster. The players play three puzzle phrases and the one with more money is the winner.<br/><br/>To begin each puzzle phrase, the gamemaster uses console to show the players which letters of the alphabet are contained in the puzzle phrase with one additional false letter called &ldquo;The Stinger.&rdquo; The gamemaster uses the wipe-off board to indicate the phrase missing its letters as one would in the game of Hangman.<br/><br/>A player may choose two letters from the console to have those letters placed in their proper positions on the wipe-off board by correctly guessing a clue word. The gamemaster  shows the number of letters there are in the clue word on the wipe-off board and then places them one at a time until one team guessed the word. Guessing the clue word gives the right to have a chance to guess the puzzle phrase.<br/><br/>When choosing letters from the console, money is added to the jackpot: $25 per letter during the first puzzle phrase, $50 per letter in the second, and $100 per letter in third. Should the player choose The Stinger with either choice the player may not guess at the puzzle phase and the game continues with a new clue word. The jackpot is won by guessing the puzzle phrase.<br/><br/>While promoted on the show (albeit with a different box during Season 1) and mostly faithful to it, the home adaptation turns the show's giant computer and keyboard into a dry-erase board and a set of plastic tiles (later cardboard letters). The bonus round is not present, either, instead awarding the Million if a player or team wins all three rounds in a game. Further, only 48 puzzles are present, allowing for just 16 games.<br/><br/>Notably, the game also included a contestant application, which is somewhat amusing since the game was given to couples who appeared on the show.<br/><br/>"",1986,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's also easy to learn due to its few and consistent rules. There's a conscious balance between a distillate simplicity, which makes it possible for everybody to play in a more relaxed - &quot;light&quot; - manner, and a depth of game which will satisfy the classic strategy game hard players.<br/><br/>In EmotrionsOnCards, the cards, called emotrions, represent the basic human feelings: love, hatred, joy, sadness, fury, indecision...

The possibility of modulating the game allows players with different profiles to enjoy, and feel the game as just right for them.<br/><br/>Philosophy<br/>All the game is a carefully made metaphor on how we manage our emotions, and other people's, in everyday life. As you try to master the strategy, you'll learn that in order to win in the long run (the game), it is always necessary to consider the effects of a particular battle (stake/trick), even if it means losing it.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to make us reflect on the fact that in real life there's no such thing as obviously good or bad situations, but more or less complex positions in which the thin line between success and failure relies on our managing little things.

"10632,Who Can Beat Nixon?,['Roll / Spin and Move'],['Political'],""This game was developed immediately after Nixon's first election, and apparently by someone who did not want him to get a second term.<br/><br/>It is a simple Monopoly-type game, but it has an interesting asymmetrical dynamic. Essentially, one player takes Nixon and up to seven play as challengers, with Nixon trying to knock them off one by one as Primary cards come up. Players still roll to land on states and buy them, and other players pay a fee when landing on them afterwards. But buying states requires a combination of two forms of currency: money and media points. Many state spaces also trigger event and media cards, which have different effects on Nixon and challengers.<br/><br/>Key to the game are the four Primary cards in the Event deck. Each time one of these comes up, Nixon rolls off with the top-ranking challenger, and whichever has the highest electoral vote total gets +2 on the 2D6. Loser is out of the game, winner grabs a state of his choice from the loser, and the rest goes back to the bank. There is a &ldquo;saved by the bell&rdquo; re-entry card in the deck that allows a loser to stay in the game.<br/><br/>There also is a provision for the challengers to join forces if Nixon seems about to win, but only if they can agree on which challenger should be the winner instead!

There are 17 different cards in the deck, some which merely pass the Hex token left, right, and across, while others split the token in two, or increase it's damage. One dismisses it entirely. One blows it up while in another player's possession. One forces the token to pass in only one direction, some cause extra effects if the token DOES blow up on you. A round ends when there are no more Hex tokens available, and there are as many rounds as there are players, plus one.<br/><br/>There are some interesting strategies that are not immediately apparent, but which become obvious after the first couple of rounds. Controlling when the last token blows up is very important since you lose and gain points based on this, so learning to play the cards to force the location of the tokens when they blow up is of paramount importance. Sending them to a player who has no cards to play works very well for this.<br/><br/>Scores are kept with individual cards monitoring &quot;Voice&quot;, which is just points.

However, a player can double or triple the value of his or her lots in a section by owning a majority or all of them, which is of course easier to do in a small section.  When a section is full the lot values are put into accounts for each player - these accounts earn interest every round, and the players are allowed to add a certain amount of cash to them as well.

"10789,All-Fours,""['Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']"",['Card Game'],""Pitch, by whatever point-variant is played, is in the similar vein as Spades and Bridge as a trick taking game.  Play uses a standard deck of 52 cards.  Players partner with the player across from them and are each dealt 9 cards.<br/><br/>The bid begins to the dealer's left at a minimum of four points and goes around the table, with players increasing the bid based on what they think they can take; if everyone passes the bid, the dealer is required to take the bid at four.  The player who announces the highest bid takes the position of dealer/leader and calls the trump suit, which is the only suit of import in this game (excepting the jokers and the left bauer or off-jack [jack of the same color, but not the trump suit]).  All players, save the dealer, discard all the cards from their hands that are not of the trump suit and request enough cards from the remaining 18-card deck to bring their hand up to 6. (*Note: If a player mistakenly discards a trump card, or one of the three other special cards, it is a free-for-all to whomever notices and picks it up off the table first)  The remaining cards in the deck are given to the bid-winner/leader, who can pick through them one-by-one, and pass any remaining unseen cards to his partner, each of them discarding to 6 before play begins.<br/><br/>Play begins with the dealer/leader leading in the trump suit.  Play proceeds around the table, with the player playing the highest valued card taking the trick and leading the following trick.  Players may only play cards that are of the trump suit, other remaining cards are useless. If a player takes a trick and no longer has cards of the trump suit, that players is out, and the player to the left then begins the trick.  Cards are ranked from Ace to Two, with the Off-Jack, High Joker, and Low Joker respectively taking the positions between the Jack and Ten.<br/><br/>Points are accrued by teams for taking the point cards in the tricks they take, which for 10-point pitch are Ace, Jack, Off-Jack (Left Bauer), High Joker, Low Joker (one has to rank higher than the other for play continuity), Ten, Three, and Two.  All are worth a point apiece, except the three, which is worth three.  The two is retained by the player who played it for his or her team and is not taken along with the trick.<br/><br/>Both teams receive points for the point cards they take, unless the high-bidding team does not meet their bid goal, in which case they go &quot;set&quot; and lose their number of bid points instead of gaining.  Teams play to 52 points.<br/><br/>Another option to bidding played in some areas is to &quot;shoot the moon.&quot; Shooting the moon means taking all 10 points. If the bid is shoot the moon the bidding team advances their score to 52 if their score was above zero or to zero if their score was below zero. Failure to score all ten points constitutes loss of game.<br/><br/><br/>Another version, playing for High, Low, Jack, and Game plays with hands of 6 cards.<br/><br/>There are four possible points in a hand:<br/><br/>High: highest trump card in play <br/>Low: lowest trump card in play; this point is retained by the team that played it regardless of who takes the trick<br/>Jack: Jack of trump, if in play<br/>Game: highest point total in tricks captured counting A - 4, K - 3, Q - 2, J - 1, and 10 - 10.<br/><br/><br/>        Variant - 6 point pitch: Jokers Add in high and low Jokers for a point each if in play. Their strength is between Jack and 10. They are always considered to be in the trump suit<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Starting at the dealer's left, each player has one chance to bid, with a minimum bid of 2. Players can overbid a previous bid. The person who wins the bid gets to name trump. Dealer has to take the bid if everyone passes, so if you have a decent hand when your partner dealt, it's a good idea to put in a 2 bid if the first person didn't bid. Not only will your partner not get stuck, but the third person to bid won't get to take an easy 2 bid if they want it, and will have to go 3.<br/><br/>If you bid and don't make it, you go down that many points. You can make points if your opponents bid.<br/><br/>After the bid and declaration of trump, some people allow trashing and getting up to 2 new cards.<br/><br/>The player who won the bid leads a trump card. After that, the person who won the previous trick leads. Players must follow the suit led if possible, or play any suit if not, and may trump in at any time. Highest card of the suit lead takes the trick, if no trump is played. If trump is played, highest trump takes it.<br/><br/>First team to 21 points wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Jersey Pitch&quot; adds the rule that the 5 of trump is worth 5 points.<br/><br/>"",1600,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With its large square box and its flat black box, Ooyoo could have been one of these strange games that we used to look with eagerness and curiosity in the Impens&eacute; Radical bookshop, in Paris, in the late seventies and early eighties. Yes, I know I'm getting old. Nothing oriental though in this game, since the exotism is fake, and author and publisher both German.<br/><br/>Ooyoo, however, is what it looks like : a simple and subtle strategy game, with three lines of rules, that could well become a classic. Like in Halma or Chinese Checkers, each player starts in a corner of the board and tries to bring all his stones in the opposite corner. The trick is in the simple and original movement rule : stones can only move by pair, two adjacent stones moving one space in the same direction. This makes for various blocking and turning strategies, especially since each player has an uneven number of stones, and can't move backwards in his own half of the board.<br/><br/>Ooyoo is much more subtle than Chinese Checkers, but doesn't pretend to be as deep and as Go - the similarity is mostly in the overall look. This excellent strategy game deserves to become a modern classic, along with Twixt, Focus or Lines of Action, and can also make for a nice and slightly lighter change for Go or Chess players. Furthermore, it really looks like an exotic traditional game that you brought back from holidays, and will make a strong impression in your lounge.<br/><br/>"",2003,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln &amp; Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize &amp; galvanize the North.<br/><br/>Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain &amp; France. London &amp; Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred &amp; bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.<br/><br/>But then, before Union &amp; Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union &amp; launching strong attacks into France &amp; Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.<br/><br/>With the CSA, Britain, France &amp; Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia &amp; Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. &quot;Home Before the Leaves Fall&quot; was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men &amp; recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.<br/><br/>With the fall of Vicksburg, &amp; Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman &amp; destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.<br/><br/>Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.<br/><br/>Until 14 September, Grant &amp; Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic &amp; set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee &amp; Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh. It would go into southern history books as the Battle of Six Bridges.<br/><br/>As noted, it is an alternative history of American Civil War, prequel of this is Wahoo! -- The Battle of Washington, July 8, 1863.<br/><br/>"",1996,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.<br/><br/>A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.<br/><br/>The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:<br/><br/>Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.<br/><br/>Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.<br/><br/>Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.<br/><br/>Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.<br/><br/>Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.<br/><br/>When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.<br/><br/>Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations.

Players must get 4 of their 5 pieces across the board and can rotate a tile 90 degrees each turn. The trick in the game is that you can move on the paths over the tiles, then move on the paths underneath the tiles, then move again on the surface.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of tile. One tile has the right angle paths in the same place on both sides. The other tile has them on different places on each side. This works because you can tell by the markings which paths are on the underside without having to look. The board is set up randomly in a 5x7 grid.<br/><br/>When travelling underneath, you must travelling under at least one stone on the surface, of either player. If you do go under an opponent's stone, you are allowed a further tile rotation at the end of your move (a key bonus that gives you an edge). You are not allowed to move a tile that your opponent just turned, but otherwise you can rotate any tile at all.<br/><br/>The new edition by Abacus is in card, with little wood posts to help lift and turn the tiles. The first edition is a nice wooden edition, part of a range of games by the firm Clemens Gerhards.<br/><br/>Moguli seems like a brain-burner at first, but quickly the possibilities become obvious, and as only a few tiles move, you can read the paths on both sides very easily. You move from trying to figure the board, to trying to figure your opponent's options and how to exploit them.

If you don't have a big enough table, fear not! The game board can be easily adapted to the size of your choice... In PLUG INN, players compete in a &quot;Macro-Game&quot; by placing their tokens on a board composed of hexagons. Every hex of the game contains a &quot;micro-game&quot; that a player must win in order to place a token in the hex. Macro and micro games are controlled by a few general rules. Even if the general rules do not change, it is always possible to pick up a new Macro-Game or add new micro-games to refresh PLUG INN.<br/><br/>The first supplied Macro-Game is Hex. In Hex, you need to place several micro-games hexes in order to form a diamond-shaped board. Each player marks two opposite sides of the diamond with his tokens. Afterwards, tokens are played in the hexes according to the rules of PLUG INN. The goal is to connect your opposite sides with an uninterrupted chain of your tokens.<br/><br/>The first micro-games are:<br/>-Trip, an interesting variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe<br/>-Kono, a simple game in which you need to capture your opponent's tokens<br/>-Bulo, a reduced variant for the classic game of Nim<br/>-Decapawn, inspired by Martin Gardner's Hexapawn, where pawns battle on the board much like in Chess<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>"",0,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The dealer MUST try to take 7 tricks, but she gets to declare which suit is trump AFTER looking at her hand.  She then gets to pick up the 4 middle cards, and discard 4 face-down (could be from the kitty, or not).  Player 2 must get 4 tricks, player 3 for 1 trick, and player 4 need not take any.<br/><br/>After round 1, figure out how many cards more or less players got.  YOu get one point for every trick you make above your required tricks, and lose one for every trick you fail to make.  For the next round, a player who had MORE in the previous round can then pass one card per amount more to a player who had less; that lesser player must then pass their HIGHEST card in each requested suit.  Some pre-defined ordering for this is necessary; the player needing to make the most tricks has precedence over the player needing less.<br/><br/>For example, in round 1, the players take 6-2-3-1 tricks.<br/>So, the position 2 is now the new dealer.  Player in position 3 was +2 in round 1 (took 3, needed 1), and would ask position 1 for 1 suit, and position 2 for 1 suit.  Player in position 4 would then ask position 2 for 1 suit.  We've played where if the numbers over/under match (position 3&amp;2, 4&amp;1 in this example), then they could simply swap cards too.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds as described above.

It is being distributed by ASGgames.<br/><br/>SherCo was the first of its kind to be played on a game board representing a composite stadium with a 28 x 28 numbered square grid. It also was the first to rate every player who played in at least one game in a season; and it was the first to provide its unique rating formulae so that customers could rate their own players and teams.<br/><br/>Each player is rated for batting average, home runs, triples, clutch-hitting, walks, strike outs, hit by pitch, base stealing speed, throwing arm, and fielding range and average; and each pitcher is rated for his ERA, innings of effectiveness, number of complete games, K/BB ratio, and home runs allowed. In the SherCo Plus versions, pitcher ratings include batting average against ratings to further refine pitcher vs. batter control and the accuracy of statistical outcomes.<br/><br/>All versions of SherCo GrandSlam Baseball (Plus and Classic) still have all of these unique features (including a wind factor; automatic umpire; artificial turf rules; injuries, hit and runs, special and freak events, and error charts; and playing pieces representing the ball, fielders, batter, and base runners so that you can position players exactly where you want them to play and watch every play unfold right before your eyes. There are also Fast Action Charts included with each season to get one-roll accurate results for games between other teams as you complete a season for your favorite team.  The new SherCo Plus variant has expanded pitcher-batter-runner ratings and offers many more realistic play results per chart, including rarities such as catcher's interference.<br/><br/>Each dice-activated result allows a patented &quot;stop-action effect&quot; to visually occur when a probable hit or probable out batted ball is plotted on a specific square on the stadium's playing field.  As the runners advance, the fielder moves to the ball, fields it and throws to where you want the ball to go in a quick, seamless sequence of turns.  A ball may drop in for a hit or become an out depending on where it is hit, the strength and direction of the wind, and where a defensive player is positioned. Depending on where you are playing, a long fly ball may be caught or go over the fence for a home run, or ricochet off the wall for a double or possible triple. We've even added an optional rule that measures the &quot;hang time&quot; of a fly ball to the outfield.(e.g., will it drop in or will the fielder have enough time to make a fantastic catch?).<br/><br/>A solitaire or head-to-head game takes only 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the score. SherCo has also re-released its rules supplement for setting up SherCo Leagues of Baseball Simulation (a/k/a SLOBS) for short-season (e.g., 24-game) leagues that you can play with family and/or friends.

With the recent Imperial victory at Breslau (November 22) Austrian forces under Prince Charles of Lorraine and Field-marshal Daun, the victor at Kolin, were only a battle away from that goal. They expected to fight this battle in the new campaign year which would begin in the coming spring.<br/><br/>For King Frederick II the loss of Silesia would not only be a devastating blow to his prestige but deprived of its resources, revenue and manpower Prussia's ability to continue the war would be desperately compromised. Rather than to allow the enemy to go unchallenged Frederick marched his remaining army of 40,000 men composed of Rossbach veterans and Breslau survivors against Charles' nearly 60,000-strong force of Austrians, Hungarians, Imperials, Bavarians and Wurttembergers.<br/><br/>On a frigid December 5th, in a season when armies usually sought the comfort of winter quarters, the opposing forces met on the snow covered fields surrounding the Silesian village of Leuthen. After deftly maneuvering around Prince Charles' flank Frederick's Prussians attacked with unprecedented fury collapsing the enemy line. However, despite this initial crushing blow the Austrians were able to reorganize their front and fight the Prussians to a standstill leaving the battle's final outcome still in doubt. Only after a climactic cavalry charge did the Habsburg army finally break and retreat to Breslau. Two weeks later the city capitulated and the Austrians evacuated Silesia. Although the war would continue for another six years Frederick would never again attain the level of success he did at Leuthen, his greatest victory.<br/><br/>Leuthen (Battles from the Age of Reason, Vol. 3) presents both gamers and students of the period with a colorful and meticulously detailed simulation with which to explore the actual events and possibilities of this definitive battle. Included is an historical commentary written especially for the game by the period's leading authority, Prof. Christopher Duffy.

Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (light gray) and ahistorical Soviet &quot;corps&quot; (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry &quot;corps&quot;). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.<br/><br/>Four bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or &quot;corps&quot;, plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.<br/><br/>Air power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).<br/><br/>The wargame includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters<br/><br/>For its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a &quot;monster game&quot; and more attentive to history than many of its rivals.

It can be opponent elimination, getting to a certain space, protecting a certain figure, or holding out for a certain number of turns.<br/><br/>Each unit in the Master Set has a movement rating ranging from 4 to 8, which is the number of hexes it can move in a turn.  Moving up a level counts as a hex; moving down does not incur that penalty. Moving down more levels than your height when moving from one hex to another counts as falling and you might take damage --unless you are falling into water.<br/><br/>Combat in the game is fairly straightforward.  You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice).  Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).<br/><br/>The master game uses a point system in which players alternate drafting cards until they reach the pre-assigned point value for the scenario.

"11179,Semper Victor,['Area Movement'],""['Ancient', 'Wargame']"",""The second game in the series that includes Imperator and Ultimus Romanorum: La Chute de Rome, Semper Victor offers a grand strategic view of the Fourth Century Roman Empire. The full campaign opens with the abdication of Emperor Diocletian (305 A.D.) and continues to the death of Julian the Apostate (in the 360's or 370's - the date is variable). Scenarios cover shorter periods, such as the fateful war between Constantine the Great and Licinius (313-324).<br/><br/>The map shows the Roman Empire in 305, divided into zones that, in turn, are grouped into 12 Dioceses, the Imperial administrative districts of that time. Surrounding the Empire are the zones of barbarian peoples and the rival Persian Empire. A turn is one year. Units have Points de Force (Strength Points) representing about 1,000 men each. Roman units come in three types: Ripenses, who cannot leave their home diocese, Pseudo-Comitatenses, whose ability to range far from home is limited, and Comitatenses, who can go anywhere in the Empire and beyond.<br/><br/>The opposing sides are unusual and may puzzle players who know little or nothing about this era. One player (dubbed &quot;Primus&quot;) represents the senior Emperor (&quot;Primus Augustus&quot;) and his allies, who may include another Augustus, one or two Caesars (junior Emperors), other Roman generals, and even non-Roman peoples. The other player (&quot;Secundus&quot;, misspelled &quot;Secondus&quot; in the rules) has his own set of Augusti, Caesars, generals and non-Romans. An important limitation is that each Augustus and Caesar must have a capital of his own, and only six capital cites are available at the beginning of the game. A seventh, Constantinople, may be constructed, though its advent is not a certainty. (Rome, by the way, is not one of the capitals; its political importance had long since faded.)<br/><br/>In the course of play, Primus and Secundus may swap positions as the result of either a successful usurpation plotted by the Secundus or the death of the Primus Augustus without an Augustus or Caesar to succeed him. In general, it is better to be Primus than Secundus, but it isn't impossible for a perpetual Secundus to win.<br/><br/>The Roman leaders are historical figures (38 in all), who enter the game at the same time as in actuality and run an increasing risk of death from natural causes if they aren't killed off sooner. Names are rendered in their French versions, e. g., &quot;Constance Chlore&quot; for Constantius Chlorus. A Leader is rated for &quot;Capacit&eacute; de Commandement&quot; (number of units he can command), &quot;Capacit&eacute; Politique&quot; (a variety of functions, such as determination of the initiative each turn), &quot;Valeur Strat&eacute;gique&quot; (ability to evade combat plus other functions) and &quot;Bonus Tactique&quot; (useful in battles). Many Leaders are also marked as Christian or Pagan, though religion has much less of an impact than it did in real life.<br/><br/>Very important to play are &quot;stratagems&quot;, which make it possible to embark on a usurpation against the other player, assassinate rival Leaders, spread plagues, trigger barbarian uprisings, pacify barbarians already at war with the Empire, inspire desertions from enemy ranks, and much else.<br/><br/>Turns have a variable number of movement/combat phases, determined by adding the valeurs strat&eacute;giques of the Primus Augustus and the highest rated Leader in the Secundus camp. The pace of the game thus depends on the quality of the current Leaders.<br/><br/>Movement and combat are straightforward. Leaders, accompanied by a number of units up to their capacit&eacute; de commandement, may move up to four zones, halting and fighting when they encounter enemies. Units without Leaders may move only one zone at a time. Battles are often bloody, but weakened or eliminated units quickly return  to full strength.<br/><br/>Players tally Victory Points at the end of each Turn. The list of achievements that garner VP's is long: victory in major battles (35 PF's or more engaged), control of Dioceses, defeat of non-Romans, presence of non-Roman troops in the other player's controlled territory, and so on.<br/><br/>Players must mount and cut the game's counters themselves, which is a non-trivial task. As a minor annoyance, the counters are a bit too big for the zones on the map.

Your powerful Stealth Force has been protecting its portion of Dimension Gemstone for centuries, but the enemy has been looming ever closer; threatening to conquer your territory.<br/><br/>Strategy - You may find that your only protection is your wide array of Stealth Attack Modules and their Concealed Power Pieces as you move through Dimension Gemstone, evading your dangerous opponent. Some of your Power Pieces can be used to destroy, while others can distract and act as decoys. The Starburst, Blaster, Ringer, Decoy and Laser each have special ways of fending off the enemy (see below). As commander of the Stealth Force, you must remember the importance of your mission - defend, retaliate and move with all possible speed. The future of Dimension Gemstone is in your hands.<br/><br/>Under Fire - The longer you wait to retaliate, the more time your opponent has to build strategy and plan the next attack. Keep focused as there are concealed dangers that may catch you unaware.<br/><br/>Escape - Dimension Gemstone has Portals that are the way for you and your Stealth Force to find a route of escape, or as a means of Surprise attack. They can zip you from one side of Dimension Gemstone to another, swiftly out of danger's way.<br/><br/>Your Mission is Clear - and it is of the utmost importance that you keep in mind the dynamics of each Stealth Attack Module. Your victory or defeat may be at stake.

The deeper the dive, the greater the rewards, but also the greater the risk of losing the catch from unwelcome events or robbery by another player.

This was the time when naval architecture and warfare underwent fundamental changes. No longer the majestic lines of the &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo;, now the three-decker with smoke belching from funnels looking out of place between the masks, the awkward shapes of the American Civil War vessels and finally the multitude of one off designs which prevailed until the start of the Pre-Dreadnought era.

"11261,Hammerin' Iron,""['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']"",""['American Civil War', 'Miniatures', 'Nautical', 'Wargame']"",""This set of rules are intended to cover the engagements that took place between 1861 and 1865 during the American Civil War. The location of the actions would be on the great rivers of the eastern seaboard of North America. Such rivers would be the James, Mississippi and Yazoo. The rules have been designed with the specific objective of providing a playable game that gives the flavour of the period by imparting the major features and generalising on lesser matters. A brief outline of the conflict would go as follows. The two sides were known as the confederates(CSA) and the Union(USA). The union tended to have a much larger fleet. At the outset the union fleet consisted of mainly wooden vessels. The confederates quickly built ironclads(armoured vessels with extremely thick armour). These ironclads quickly proved wooden ships to be greatly inferior. This was illustrated several times when a single confederate ironclad would scatter four or five wooden ships. The CSA ships tended to be conversions . The quality of engines, materials and armaments varied wildly often toward the poorer end. The USA soon fielded some excellent ironclads along the famous monitor design which overall were better ships than the long CSA Ram/Ironclads.<br/><br/>As far as guns were concerned there are a few generalities that may give the player more feel for the period. The principles of fire and effect fell into two ideals. The first ideal was that of &ldquo;punching&rdquo;. Punching was the concept of the round going through the armour and causing great damage inside. Battering was the concept of smashing against the armour so hard that the plates would break off or the force would be transmitted to the area beyond the armour. Both methods have merit but it is punching that rules modern day thinking now that such items as fused shells and very high velocity guns are available.<br/><br/>To play this game there is an amount of equipment to be assembled.<br/>1. Ships to 1/600th scale.<br/>2. Enough 15mm scale figures and guns to represent the gun deck of the ship.<br/>3. A piece of card or model to 13mm scale upon which to put the figures, thus showing the exact position.<br/>4. Hexagons inscribed in 5.5&rdquo; circles for movement purposes. (2 for each ship)<br/>6. Some ordinary 1-6 sided dice.<br/>7. Some scenery for sandbars and shore batteries.<br/>8. Paper to note down damage.<br/>9. A blue cloth or similar.<br/>10.

But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.<br/><br/>In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.<br/><br/>In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.<br/><br/>The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)<br/>&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters<br/>&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards<br/><br/>TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  <br/>MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   <br/>UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies<br/><br/>DESIGNERS Vance von Borries<br/>DEVELOPER Tony Curtis<br/>MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.<br/><br/>Scenarios: <br/>1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.<br/><br/>2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?<br/><br/>4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.<br/><br/>"",2004,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After rounding Cape Hatteras in a 60' schooner, they found refuge from the storm in Silver Lake Harbor on Orcacoke Island. During their stay on Ocracoke they found the Outer Banks life-style so unique that they were inspired to capture that feeling, and the game of Beachcomber came to life.<br/><br/>BASIC SUMMARY: This is a card game in the vein of Mille Bornes. One's goal is to collect the most shells (similar to mileage cards). The quantity of shells one can pick up is based on the mode of transportation (food, bike, 4x4), and there are various problems that can slow you down (soft sand, no reservation, hot sand). You must be on vacation to collect shells (similar to the Go card), and there are things that can frustrate the vacation (hotel bill, food bill, beach gear bill, and gas bill); bills can be addressed with money or &quot;super solutions.&quot;<br/><br/>"",1984,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They take turns playing cards for themselves and their partners with trump shifting when they cannot follow suit. Cards are worth their face value (0 to 10), but tricks cost 20 points! Thus they want to take the valuable tricks and make their opponent take the costly tricks.<br/><br/>Buddy on your Left: a game for 3 players where each player's score is his own plus that of his left hand neighbor!<br/>A card is led then players in turn play cards either higher or lower than the lead card. As long as the played cards are lower, the pile continues to grow. As soon as a card higher in value than the initial card is played, that player sweeps the entire pile. Cards from 1 to 6 score their value, 7 to 10 are worth nothing. After the last card is played, you score for the cards you collected plus the cards your left hand opponent collected. Highest score wins.<br/><br/>The Third Man: an outrageous bidding game for 4 players<br/>The game consists of a series of auctions, for each of which the house puts up a prize fund of 10 points. Highest bidder gets the 10 points, less the number he had bid (ex. if he bid 9, he earns 1). The second highest bidder loses the full amount he had bid (ex. if he bid 7 he loses 7).

Each army has (in descending order of strength) one leader, one wizard, three bowmen, four pikemen, and four warriors.  They also have two shield-bearers.  On the back of each chit is simply an orc face or a human face, which, if used in combat, is lower than a warrior.<br/><br/>On a given turn, each player secretly selects three units, keeping the remaining units face down in front of him.   The players take turns dropping them onto a cloth surface (tablecloth or towel on a table) from about a foot above the table (30 cm).  Whichever side they land face up is their strength for the current round.<br/><br/>Certain faces have different abilities, however:<br/><br/>     a human or orc face allows you to call for reinforcements (one additional chip from your unused chips) for each face showing),<br/>     a shield bearer allows you to protect one unit in the upcoming combat<br/>     a wizard may force a re-drop of all pieces except itself<br/>     a leader allows you re-drop any one chip (morale).<br/><br/><br/>After all special abilities are used, line up your troops from strongest to weakest, and compare with your opponents.   The two strongest fight each other, with the loser removed from the game (remove both in case of ties).  Then the next two strongest fight, etc.  Shield bearers can be assigned to any chips.  A shielded chip attacks but may not be killed - remove the shield from the game, instead.<br/><br/>When one side loses its leader, the game is over and the other side is victorious.<br/><br/>While it sounds simple, your choices are actually not always easy.  If you risk your leader and it lands the wrong side up, it's the weakest piece on the board.  You can call for reinforcements, but units used in earlier combats cannot be called until all combats with the units that started that round have been completed.<br/><br/>For those who dislike the mechanic of dropping chips, you could use a die roll, coin flip, or card cut for each piece to determine its facing.<br/><br/>"",2001,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.

Unfortunately, that means you have to do all the bookkeeping on paper that the computer could do easily.  Most players will find it a bit tedious to constantly have to calculate and record population, crops, seed, food, weapons, etc.  However, we sometimes play it at a restaurant while waiting for the food to come - it's not a bad way to pass the time, really, when you don't have less portable games around.<br/><br/>The game consists of a rules/events booklet, three six-sided dice, and a pad of record sheets.  The game is set in a mythical Renaissance-era kingdom, with each player playing a separate village in that kingdom.  You can trade goods with each other each turn, but can only attack others when you roll a &quot;1&quot; for an event table.<br/><br/>To play, each player takes a record sheet (you may need more than one per person, depending on how long the game lasts) and a pencil.  Determine first player, and write down your starting village: 5 each of people, gold, land, food, and seed.  The seed can go into either the ground as crops or storage - you should have some of each for safety.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she rolls the three dice.  The red die tells you which table to look under: Attacks, Catastrophes, Good Times, Mixed Events, All Players Involved, or More Mixed Events.  The green (or yellow in some sets) die is then the &quot;tens&quot; digit, and the white die the &quot;ones&quot; digit.  So a roll of 5, 4, 1 means you look at event #41 on table 5.

You assign your people to weapon making or harvesting - they can't do both in the same turn.  Then the next player takes their turn at the event table, after which ALL players repeat the harvest, weapons, food, seed, etc.  This is the part that drives some people crazy - there's a LOT of record keeping.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches either 20 land units, 200 gold, or reaches a population of 35 people.

It's a simple game of space ship combat between either two players or two teams.<br/><br/>You first design your spaceships, assigning shields, armor, weapons, fighter hangars, etc., to spaces in a circle with different levels. The core of the circle represents both the bridge and the power plant of the spaceship - you don't want it hit! The circles are divided into twelve sections, like a clock.<br/><br/>Once you all have ships, you draw a triangle for each base and take turns plotting movement. Movement is handled by the template: line the center of the template over your current position, with your previous position directly to the rear. The template is divided into arcs of distance. If you move eight arc lengths last turn, you will continue to move eight in a straight line - make a slight mark on the paper to note that.

A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).<br/><br/>Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (&quot;Battle&quot;) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' &quot;natural enemy&quot;.) The other type of Attack Card (&quot;Mercenary Army&quot;) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.<br/><br/>The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.<br/><br/>Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.<br/><br/>"",2004,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.<br/><br/>On February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.<br/><br/>Orthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack.

The farm was using specialized Japanese-made machinery that had Kanji characters on them, so Israeli military maps labeled the area as 'Chinese Farm'.[1][2] The battle began when the IDF launched Operation Abiray-Lev (&quot;Stouthearted Men&quot;), attempting to establish a corridor to the canal and allow bridges to be laid for a crossing.

The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but were unable to make much headway, only managing to seize an important crossroad on the second day. Suffering from a lack of infantry, the Israelis brought up paratroopers during the night of October 16/17. They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.<br/><br/>The Egyptians attempted to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day.

A piece may only move along the lines inscribed upon the board.  For each turn a piece makes either a capturing move or an ordinary move.<br/>Whenever a piece has an opponent's piece adjacent to it and the point immediately beyond the opponent's piece is vacant, the opponent's piece can be captured.  A piece is taken by simply hopping over it into the vacant point beyond and removing it from the board.  Unlike an ordinary move, a capturing move can consist of several such hops - if a piece takes an opponent's piece and the new position allows it to take another piece, then it can do so straight away.  The move finishes when the position of the capturing piece no longer allows it to taken any more pieces or the player could make another capture but decides not to.<br/><br/>An ordinary move is made by simply moving a piece along a line to an adjacent point.<br/>Finishing<br/>The game is won by the player who first manages to take all his opponent's pieces or by the player who has more pieces when it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken.   Alternatively, a player can win by rendering the other player unable to move. <br/>A draw occurs by agreement at any point during the game.  If it becomes apparent that no more pieces will be taken and both players have the same number of pieces left, a draw is agreed.  Draws are very common.<br/><br/>Arie van der Stoep's reconstruction:<br/><br/>In his book Draughts in relation to chess and alquerque (2005) Arie van der Stoep contends that Alquerque de doze was in medieval times played by the following rules. Counters can move and capture, by the short leap, forwards and sideways. Capture is not compulsory. Counters are promoted to Sultans at the last rank. The Sultan (King) moves and captures in all directions. Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters.<br/><br/>There existed two variants of Medieval Alquerque. In one version the Sultan can only move one square (short Sultan), and captures by the short leap. This was foremostly played in countries within the Roman sphere of influence. In the other variant the Sultan moves any number of squares, and captures like the King in international draughts, landing anywhere behind the captured piece. This was foremostly played in countries within the Arabic sphere of influence. In Sultan endgames, a majority of at least two Sultans is necessary for a win.<br/><br/>"",1000,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In fact, it is really just a direct steal from TACTICAL GAME No. 3 of the TSG. What I hope it will do is provide that real bridge between board and miniatures, to get each side of the fence partly on the other. Miniature wargamers are going to find having combat factors and a CRT a bit strange, while board wargamers are going to find all those tank models and painted figures weird too. In fact, the lack of hexagons alone is startling enough.<br/><br/>The rules are neither complex nor comprehensive, if anything they were designed to be clear. This game is a 'quickie', fast to set up, almost as fast to play. For those tactical historians with the &quot;what if--&quot;, it is a tool for endless answers. By now you should have enough organizational information to be able to set up various German and Russian formations using platoons and companies as building blocks. Pick your terrain and objectives, and have at it. If your imagination fails you, some reading into the real campaign and some of the battles should produce enough food for thought. For the fun-minded, I personally have a set of &quot;orders&quot; cards each containing an order of battle and a mission for one side. I set up a Russian and German deck before each battle, and thus players remain in the dark about enemy forces and objectives<br/><br/>For those who find Tac 3/20mm just a nice take-off point for 1944 vintage land miniatures, note that S&amp;T does indeed have considerably more detailed and simulation-oriented rules around.

Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle River by the end of the fighting.<br/><br/>The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000&ndash;60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&rsquo;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind.

The Union forces were repulsed and retreated to Jacksonville where they stayed for the remainder of the war.<br/><br/>Following the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, Seymour led his 5,500 men in the direction of Lake City. At approximately 2:30 in the afternoon of February 20, the Union force approached General Finnegan's 5,000 Confederates entrenched near Olustee Station. Finnegan sent out an infantry brigade to meet Seymour's advance units and lure them into the Confederate entrenchments, but this plan went awry. The opposing forces met at Ocean Pond and the battle began. Seymour made the mistake of assuming he was once again facing Florida militia units he had previously routed with ease and committed his troops piecemeal into the battle. Finnegan and Seymour both reinforced their engaged units during the afternoon and the battle took place in open pine woods. The Union forces attacked but were savagely repulsed by withering barrages of rifle and cannon fire.<br/><br/>The battle raged throughout the afternoon until, as Finnegan committed the last of his reserves, the Union line broke and began to retreat. Finnegan did not exploit the retreat, allowing most of the fleeing Union forces to reach Jacksonville. However, the Confederates did make a final attempt to engage the rear element of Seymour's forces just before nightfall, but they were repulsed by elements of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 35th United States Colored Troops, both composed of black soldiers.

"11640,Bela,""['Set Collection', 'Trick-taking']"",['Card Game'],""From The Complete Book of Indoor Games by Peter Arnold:<br/><br/>Klabberjass is probably best known in America than in England, because under the names of Clabber,Clobber, Clubby, Klab and Klob, it occurs in Damon Runyon's amusing stories,and in 1937 a variation of the game, jo-jotte was publicized by Ely Culbertson. Despite the simularity of names it is not idenical with the Hungarian game of kalabrias, which is a game for three or four players. There may have been a common ancestor, or possibly the game was taken to the New World by Central European immigrants and there bowdlerized version of kalabrias. (Exeter Books, 1984)<br/><br/>Klabberjass is played in the North American and Great Britain with the 32 card deck. (6s, 5s,4s,3s, and 2s removed from the standard 52 card deck.) The trump suit enjoys the strange ranking of the Jass genre: J 9 A 10 K Q 8 7. Non trump suit rank A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 as in the Skat-Pinochle family. Six cards are dealt to each player and a card is turned up. Non-dealer then begins a bidding round to first to accept the turn-up as trump. Or pass. If both pass on the turn-up card a second round is held. Here the non-dealer may take the bid by naming one of the other three suits or pass, dealer than may take the bid by naming the suit of throw in the hand. (Some allow for a bid of &quot;Schmeiss&quot; which means to the bidder will take the hand with the turn-up or the hand can be thrown in at the non-bidders discretion)<br/><br/>After bidding, the dealer deals three more cards to the hand. Then sequences are scored. For this purpose the cards revert back to their numeral rank. A sequence of three scores 20 and a sequence of 4 or more scores 50. tiebreakers are decided by rank. As I will describe later, it may make sense not to score in this round and you are not obligated to do so.<br/><br/>Non-dealer leads to first trick. A player must follow suit. If he cannot he must trump if able. If trump is lead he must play a higher trump if able. If he holds the King and Queen of trump he may announce &quot;Bella&quot; on play of the second card and score 50 points. Once again he may choose not to score for this.<br/><br/>After the cards are played, both score for the following cards won:<br/><br/>Jass (Jack of Trumps) 20 points<br/>Menel (9 of Trumps) 14 points.<br/>Any Ace 11 points<br/>Any 10 10 points.<br/>Any King 4 points.<br/>Any Queen 3 points.<br/>Any Jack 2 points.<br/>Last Trick 10 points.<br/><br/>If the the high bidder (The one who established trump) scores the highest, both sides score what they made. If if opponent scores higher he scores for both totals. This is why the high bidder who realizes he is not going to beat his opponent in this hand may decide not to score or &quot;Sink&quot; points during the hand. 500 points wins the round.<br/><br/>Prior to the onset of Gin Rummy, this was the most popular two handed game in the United States. It still holds a loyal following.<br/><br/>Klabberjass remains a popular two handed game in the United States. There are several variations in play and several house rules.

The name of the work has been Due Secoli di Guerre: &ldquo;Two Centuries of Wars&rdquo;<br/><br/>Emilio Ceretti, chief of the Editrice Giochi, asked to Alex Randolph to invent a boardgame inspired to the encyclopedia.<br/><br/>Being impossible to simulate battles in a period of time from gunpowder to jet fighters, the result is a sort of an abstract wargame which tries to contain some fixed elements of war: strength vs. mobility, random factor, and bluff.<br/><br/>The game components are:<br/>-a board with an irregular tessellation<br/>-60 grey pieces with 3 holes each<br/>-120 flags, 30 for every color (red, green, yellow, blue)<br/>-the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;<br/><br/>Every player gets 30 flags of his color, and places them on 15 grey pieces. A piece with 3 flags has strength 3 and can move one space. A piece with 2 flags has strength 2 and can move up to two spaces&hellip; and I think the readers can guess the features of a piece with one flag on it&hellip;<br/><br/>Every player enters his units in the map from one side, and tries to win being the first to reach the opposite side with one of his units.<br/><br/>The combat system is quite original, and uses the &ldquo;bluffing bell&rdquo;. This is a little device similar to an hand-bell, containing two little 6-sided dices. Shaking the device makes the dices roll, and pressing the device on the table causes the dices to be blocked on their result. After the pressing of the &ldquo;bell&rdquo;, the player who is using it can pull it up and see the result, without showing it to other players. The player can repeat the shaking a number of times equal to the number of his flags involved in the combat, until he is satisfied (or wants to feign to be satisfied) by the result: at this point he can declare a result (obviously he can declare a number different from the real one!)<br/>The opponent can now accept the declared result, and then try to get and declare an higher number; elsewhere he can try to see the bluff&hellip;<br/><br/>Entering the central red square allows the player to aim an &ldquo;artillery shot&rdquo; to an enemy unit.<br/><br/>According to Alex Randolph&rsquo;s ludography compiled by Philippe Evrard, &ldquo;Due Secoli di Guerre&rdquo; has been published only in Italy by Editrice Giochi, and there is no report about editions in other countries.<br/><br/>"",1982,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"11646,Cent,""['Set Collection', 'Trick-taking']"",['Card Game'],""Piquet is a very old trick-taking card game for 2 players, reportedly invented by a M. Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.<br/><br/>A 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a &quot;Piquet Deck&quot;). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the &quot;Cents&quot; version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.<br/><br/>Play consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.<br/><br/>In the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.<br/><br/>The small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.<br/><br/>"",1534,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this way you convert tiles of your opponent to your own colour. Tiles always move individually: you do not move entire stacks, just the stack's top tile. When capturing, you capture the entire stack.<br/><br/>You can surrender to tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or higher. Instead of jumping on top of the stack, you slide underneath it. Your tile is not flipped, and it keeps its own colour. It is a prisoner of that stack. But if a stack holds a majority of prisoners (more than half), there is a revolution. The prisoners become free, and the top tile (and all other tiles of the stack) change to the colour of the prisoners.<br/><br/>The game ends if one of the players can make no more moves.<br/><br/>A winner of the 1995 Concours International de Créateurs de Jeux de Société.<br/><br/>"",1996,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It would appear from the picture that &quot;rows&quot; can run in any direction, which means that the &quot;heaps&quot; intersect. This is not what most people know as Nim. Also, according to the original description, in this version the loser is the player who has to remove the last peg. This is so-called &quot;misere play&quot;, rather than the standard winning condition. Many combinatorial games allow mis&egrave;re play as a variation.<br/><br/>Nim is solved, which means that from any initial configuration, one can readily determine whether the next player or the previous player has a winning strategy, and identify a good next move in the former case. For Nim, this can be determined surprisingly readily no matter the size of the heaps, but you're not going to get the secret from me.<br/><br/>As most who would be interested in Nim know the solution, there isn't much of a game here. But Nim plays a central role in the theory of combinatorial games, as any two-player finite impartial game is in some sense Nim in disguise: any position in such a game corresponds to a unique Nim-heap, and one can play the disguised game perfectly by making the moves that correspond to winning moves in Nim. Sprouts is one example. This however does not mean that Sprouts itself is solved, as the &quot;disguise&quot; is only partially revealed.<br/><br/>"",0,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only Zithium and Beton Crystals from the Planet of Fire and the Ice Planet can destroy it.<br/>Your Mission. Bring back both Crystals and plant them in the War Ship Bridge. Look out for the Blurg, the Spider and the Klingons.  Also look Out For Refuge Squares, Avoid Capture, Closed Circuit TV, Alarms and the Baroom Card!!<br/><br/>This Star Trek Game is a board game for two to six players produced in 1975 by Palitoy for the UK game market. This game is TOS-based, and was advertised as &quot;Taken from the popular BBC TV Series Star Trek&quot;. Much of the game's artwork seems to have been done by &ndash; or at least, influenced by &ndash; the artists who worked on the Gold Key Star Trek comic. Players play crewmembers of the Enterprise assigned to obtain alien crystals from two planets that can be used to destroy a nearby Klingon warship, while avoiding capture by either the Klingons or the indigenous creatures on either planet.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The object of the game is to land on two planets &ndash; the &quot;Planet of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Ice Planet&quot; &ndash; to retrieve a sample of &quot;Zithium&quot; and &quot;Beton&quot; (respectively) to use against the Klingons and destroy their ship.<br/>As crewmembers of the Enterprise, you have been assigned to obtain a crystal of each substance from their respective plantes, while avoiding a giant alien spider (which protects the crystals on the Planet of Fire) and an amorphous blob called a Blurg (who protects the crystals on the Ice Planet).<br/><br/>Each player starts in the Enterprise transporter room and tries to roll the number of the transporter pad to which they are assigned to &quot;beam down&quot; to one of the planets. (If they cannot do this within three rolls, they &quot;beam down&quot; automatically.) The player then traverses the game path on the planet to try and reach the cavern containing the crystals at the path's end. Players can obtain help from Kirk or Spock by landing on the space with their picture. They can also be captured if landed on by either creature or a Klingon (spaces on the path allow either the creatures to move or the Klingons to beam down to the planets), but by the player having Kirk and/or Spock with them, the player can have their &quot;senior officer&quot; &quot;stun&quot; their attacker and continue play.<br/><br/>Once a player obtains the crystal from one planet, they return to the Enterprise and go through &quot;decontamination&quot; (moving along the red and white path near the transporter room). They then return to the transporter (via the yellow and green path) and attempt to &quot;beam down&quot; to the other planet and get the second crystal. They then return to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; again before proceeding to the Enterprise's &quot;airlock&quot; and attempting to board the Klingon ship. From their, the player must enter the Klingon bridge, plant the crystals, and beam back to the Enterprise and undergo &quot;decontamination&quot; a third time before landing on the &quot;Detonator&quot; space and playing the &quot;Baroom&quot; card on the Klingon ship, thus destroying it and winning the game.<br/><br/>Source: Memory Alpha Wiki<br/><br/>"",1975,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"11780,ASG Baseball,['Simulation'],['Sports'],""ASG Baseball is a tabletop baseball simulation which uses individual batter and pitcher cards and dice to accurately recreate games between Major League Baseball teams. The game's distinctivie design feature is that batter-pitcher encounters are resolved by rolling the dice and consulting the pitcher's card. In some cases the outcome of the play is determined directly from the pitcher's card. In other cases the pitcher's card may direct you to a specific column (one of six) on the batter's card for the play result. The columns on the batter's card are organized to reflect the batter's normal, above-normal, and below normal batting average and slugging percentage.  Advocates of the game argue that dominant pitchers are more realistically simulated by this play design in that they exert more control over the outcome of each at bat than is the case for better-known baseball boardgames such as APBA and Strat-O-Matic.<br/><br/>ASG also includes clutch hitting, errors, fielders' range, fielders' arm strength, infielders' double play ability, catchers' pitch calling, balks, wild pitches, stolen bases, stamina and unusual plays.<br/><br/>The game was introduced in 1973 with player cards based upon the 1972 major league season.  The following year the company issued player cards based upon the 1973 season.  Afterward, faced with demands from the Major League Players Association for royalty payments for the use of player and team names, the game creator ceased production until the game was resurrected by 3W Games in the late 1980's.  Later, the board game was adapted to the personal computer and the software was sold under the name Diamond Dreams.

Every area has a potential number which indicates how likely it is to find something (fertile soil, coal, copper, silver, of gold) there.  Each number has an associated set of outcomes for a 2-dice roll, which in addition to finding something include action cards from the deck, action cards from other players, income, and monetary penalties.  Areas not likely to produce soil, coal, or minerals are more likely to provide cards or income.<br/><br/>Once you find something, you get paid for the claim and that area is done with.  Some things pay better than others, with gold of course paying the most, but this is offset by the fact that making the same strike in an adjacent area will pay double (and a third will double again, etc.), and the less valuable items are easier to find.<br/><br/>Action cards can be used to rob or tax other players, travel faster around the board, squat on someone else's claim, etc.  The &quot;take that&quot; effect is presumably somewhat reduced by the small hand size (2 in a 4-player game).<br/><br/>The attention to usability in the components is somewhat unusual for a self-published game of this vintage.  Each player gets a &quot;calculator&quot; which lets you slide a cardboard strip up and down to get the dice-rolling chart for each claim potential (and robbery attempt) individually, instead of having to look it up in a larger chart.

EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.<br/><br/>As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.<br/><br/>Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.<br/><br/>The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.<br/>EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability.

MacGowan<br/><br/><br/>(from the designer:)<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.<br/><br/>The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.<br/><br/>The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.<br/><br/>As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.<br/><br/>Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.<br/><br/>Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.<br/><br/>Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.<br/><br/>"",2005,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"11826,Cyberpunk 2013: The Collectible Card Game,[],""['Card Game', 'Collectible Components']"",""From the Website<br/><br/>Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game is a game based in the near dark future of the Cyberpunk world. The world of Cyberpunk is a world in which corporations are the elite ruling class, dark soldiers of fortune rule the streets, and everybody has a price. It is a world based very much on authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and movies such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (which was based on a Gibson story), and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br/><br/>Combining the elements of these popular worlds, Cyberpunk the CCG is a game where the player sits down to play the special agenda of one of the world's ruling groups (or Sponsors.) The player brings Hackers, Gangers, Rockers, Solos, and many other characters into a cohesive team under their command and then sends them on missions (Black Ops). Once the player has scored 100 ops points by completing missions (each mission is worth a different amount of points) the player wins. However -- in this world of intrigue and backstabbing - style is just as important. A player can also win if they manage to gather 100 points of style. The final way that a player can win is through the special agenda of their sponsor; each of the seven sponsors has a different agenda.<br/><br/>2013 Edition released in December, 2003 as a limited edition; 2020 Edition released February, 2004<br/><br/>"",2003,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The stagecoach moves one or two spaces (determined by a die roll) along a fixed path toward East City.  The outlaw moves one or two spaces forward or backward, and may utilize the shortcuts.  Once the outlaw ends a move on the same space as the stagecoach, a gunfight occurs.  The gunfight consists of the outlaw winning three out of three rounds of &quot;Who can roll a higher number on the die?&quot; - re-rolling in the event of a tie.  If the stagecoach wins the gunfight, it escapes with a free move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Shark Attack sends 2-4 players diving for treasure in slightly shark-infested waters.  On your turn, you roll a die, then move in orthogonal steps, generally toward the treasure.  You may not swim through other pawns.  If you start your turn in the shark attack zone, which is 4/7 of the playfield, then you will also roll and move the shark.  The shark may swim through other pawns, but if it ends its movement on a player's pawn, that pawn goes back to the boat and starts over.  The goal is not only to get past the shark to reach the treasure, but also return through the shark's waters to the boat thereafter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Alien Invaders From Space is a 1-player roll-and-move with a die-driven squad of aliens hunting you along the path.  A die roll indicates which 3-4 of six rooms are occupied by aliens.  For your attempted escape, each turn, you roll a die.  On an even roll, you move that many spaces; odd, the alien in the current room (if any) moves that many spaces, eventually getting into your path and threatening you.  One exception:  If you roll a 1, the aliens all get reset, and you roll again to determine their new three or four starting rooms.  You simply try to reach your &quot;rocket ship to Earth&quot; without a turn ending you and an alien on the same space.<br/><br/><br/>"",1981,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Four missiles are bearing down on Earth, and you make straight, orthogonal moves based on the die roll, trying to hit the missiles before they reach Earth.

Not only are the robots inherently &frac14; the speed of the spaceman, but they also are unable to move backward, toward the ship.

Player tokens are altered - now you can choose from a jeep, teddy bear, blow drier, leather cap, handcuffs or a stiletto heel.  Properties have been changed to a 'gay' theme as well - e.g. Fire Island and Castro Street.  Instead of buying houses and hotels, you can buy bars and bathhouses.  The money denominations include $3.00 bills.<br/><br/>One departure from the original Monopoly is the inclusion of Family Pride cards.  When landing on the appropriate space, the description of a famous gay man is read aloud, and the player who can correctly identify the person can move ahead to any space on the board.  Also different is the addition of Camp Cards.  When these are drawn, you must perform the indicated action (ie. 'say: 'faaabulous!' six different ways and receive $3).  Finally, there are &quot;hanky code&quot; cards, where the player must identify what each color of the code meant, and what it meant when worn in each (left and right) rear pants pocket.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that there were only a very limited number of copies of this game, as it was produced by The Parker Sisters, a division of Fire Island games, and were sued for copyright infringement by Parker Brothers (the company is no longer in business).<br/><br/>"",1983,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"11865,Koi-Koi,""['Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection']"",['Card Game'],""A traditional two-player Japanese card game played with the beautiful Hanafuda (literally 'Flower card') deck.<br/><br/>Setup: the cards are all shuffled, and one card is randomly revealed: the player whom the birthday month is closer to the revealed card month is the first player and thus the dealer. The cards are shuffled again and handed out, two by two, to both players, as for the face-up talon in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Turn: Then each player proceeds as so: firstly, he discards a card face up on the table from his hand. If that card matches another card on the table (matching months), the player then wins both cards which he puts in his face-up collection, in front of him. The collection is always displayed in 4 columns, as so: Flowers, Ribbons, Animals and Specials. If it doesn't match anything, the discarded card stays on the table. Secondly, whether it matched or not, the player then draws the first card from the face down deck, and proceeds the same way: if it doesn't match any card, the drawn card stays on the table, but if it does match a card, the player wins both cards which he adds to his collection. Then the other player takes his turn.<br/><br/>Turn's End: At the end of a player's turn, if he has any Yaku, he can stop the current month (inning) by stating his Yakus, then the points are scored and the next month begins. However, if he wishes to continue in order to increase his score for this month, he says &quot;Koi-Koi&quot; and the other player takes his turn. If later on during the game, the player who said Koi-Koi wins another Yaku OR increases his previous Yakus, he can then again stop the game or say Koi-Koi, as many times as he wants. But if a player gets a Yaku in a game where his opponent already said Koi-Koi, then he gets the right either to say Koi-Koi too, or to stop the game and receive his points, thus leading his opponent to get no points at all this month.<br/><br/>End: Since each player has 8 cards in his hand, a month (inning) can at worse last 16 turns. In case of a game where one (or both) player(s) said Koi-Koi and no more Yakus have been added or increased before the month ends, then only the last player who said Koi-Koi scores his points as usual. The winner of a month becomes the dealer for the next month, or stays the same if there was not any winner.<br/><br/>Each Yaku can add itself to the others. Here are the Yakus:<br/><br/>Basic Yakus<br/><br/>10 Flowers / Kasu : 1 point (Each additional Flower adds 1 point)<br/>5 Ribbons / Tanzaku : 1 point (Each additional Ribbon adds 1 point)<br/>3 Purple Ribbons (blue) / Aotan : 5 points<br/>3 Ribbons with Poems (red) / Akatan : 5 points<br/>5 Animals / Tane : 1 Point (Each additional Animal adds 1 point)<br/>Doe + Boar + Butterflies / Ino Shika Ch&ocirc; : 5 Points<br/>3 Specials without the Rain Man / Sank&ocirc; : 5 Points<br/>4 Specials with the Rain Man / Ameshik&ocirc; : 6 points<br/>4 Special without the Rain Man / Shik&ocirc; : 8 Points<br/>5 Specials : Gok&ocirc; : 10 points<br/><br/>Special Yakus<br/><br/>The Moon + The Sake Cup / Tsukizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)<br/>The Cherry Curtain + The Sake Cup / Hanamizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)<br/>The Iris Flower is a &quot;Joker&quot; card: it can either be counted as an Animal, or as Flower to form a Kasu (but not both).<br/>The 4 Cards of the current Month / TsukiFuda : 5 points<br/>No Yakus / OyaKen : 1 point<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches 50 points.

If this player is wrong in their claim, they keep the card on the table in front of them face up; if they are right, the player who gave them the card places it face up before them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Peeks at the card, then passes it face down to another player, either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must take the first option.<br/><br/><br/>Whoever lost a challenge and had to place the card before them on the table begins the next round.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on their turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of them. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.<br/><br/>"",2004,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
