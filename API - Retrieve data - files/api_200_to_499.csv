"200,Entdecker,""['Area Majority / Influence', 'Modular Board', 'Tile Placement']"",['Exploration'],""[Careful: there are two similar games with Entdecker in the title. Don't confuse Entdecker with Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons), a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board has a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]<br/><br/>Entdecker starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all. Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Die Neuen Entdecker or Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In 2004, a smaller version of the Entdecker game was released, based on the online version available on the <a target='_blank' href=""""http://www.playcatan.de"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer noopener"""">www.playcatan.de</a> site.<br/>         Oceania.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     In 2007, the game system was revamped in a new &quot;Entdecker&quot;-series of 3 titles (so far):<br/>         Im Reich der Jadegottin (published 2007)<br/>         Im Reich der Wüstensohne (published 2008)<br/>         Im Reich der D&auml;monen (not yet published)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>"",1996,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.<br/><br/>Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).<br/><br/>Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series. The republication also included a re-theming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) - the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.<br/><br/>Rosenk&ouml;nig is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>"",1992,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And also keep your home village! By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook<br/><br/>Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.<br/><br/>Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.<br/><br/>The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game.

"208,Ex & Hopp,[],['Card Game'],""A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.<br/><br/>When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative.

It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.<br/><br/>The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination &mdash; single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. &mdash; or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one.

At the start of a round, each player can call &quot;Tichu&quot; prior to playing any card.

"218,Auction,""['Auction/Bidding', 'Set Collection']"",['Negotiation'],""Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.<br/><br/>These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.<br/><br/>There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.<br/><br/>When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.<br/><br/>Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:<br/><br/>1) Purchase properties, as described above;<br/><br/>2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or<br/><br/>3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.<br/><br/>So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.<br/><br/>Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.<br/><br/>As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.<br/><br/>"",1963,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"219,Volle Hutte,""['Hand Management', 'Tile Placement']"",['Economic'],""Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.<br/><br/>Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.<br/><br/>When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.<br/><br/>This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.<br/><br/>So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.<br/><br/>And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).<br/><br/>There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.<br/><br/>Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.  Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.<br/><br/>At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.<br/><br/>Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).<br/><br/>After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>"",1991,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"232,Méditerranée,""['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Trading', 'Turn Order: Auction']"",""['Economic', 'Nautical', 'Renaissance']"",""The Theme<br/><br/>In the fourteenth century, the Atlantic was an ocean without end and America was yet to be discovered. The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.<br/><br/>Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.<br/><br/>In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered &quot;full&quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).<br/><br/>During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.<br/><br/>The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.<br/><br/>"",1996,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...<br/><br/>Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.<br/><br/>The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.<br/><br/>The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties.

Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.<br/><br/>Mercator : 3-7 players<br/><br/>This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.<br/><br/>Imperium : 3-5 players<br/><br/>The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.<br/><br/>Senator : 2-3 players<br/><br/>You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.<br/><br/>Circus Maximus : 3-5 players<br/><br/>A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.<br/><br/>Consul : 2-4 players<br/><br/>This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.<br/><br/>Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome.<br/><br/>"",1994,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.<br/><br/>If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank.

One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.<br/><br/>The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.<br/><br/>It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.<br/>See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.<br/><br/>Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar.

A die can't move through another piece, but it can wrap around the side of the board and it can bounce off the front or back wall at an angle to move its full distance.<br/><br/>If you land a die on an opponent's die, that second die is removed and the value of that die added to the lowest die on the opponent's team, keeping their pip count at 25. (If a die reaches 6, you add any remaining speed to what is now the lowest die.) If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.<br/><br/>Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same.

"334,Advance to Boardwalk,""['Area Majority / Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Take That']"",['Economic'],""Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.<br/><br/>There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.<br/><br/>If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.<br/><br/>When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.<br/><br/>Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinländer, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk.

Each other player takes one final turn, then plays as many cards as they can in words.

"344,Classic Art,""['Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management']"",['Card Game'],""In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!<br/><br/>The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.<br/><br/>In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.<br/><br/>At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.<br/><br/>At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.<br/><br/>A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.<br/><br/>Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand.

The plastic board has 100 holes, numbered in a oft reversing spiral with 1 in the center. A deck of numbered cards from 1-100 is shuffled and players start with 4 each. You may either play a card and stick a peg in, or draw a card, the hand limit being 4. And of course, you're trying to get five of your pegs in a row to win. Simple, except that playing a card allows you to place a peg in that number, or any empty number above. So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block.

Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.<br/><br/>The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.<br/><br/>Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.<br/><br/>Disaster cards may be played as discards.

"380,Polarity,['Stacking and Balancing'],""['Abstract Strategy', 'Action / Dexterity']"",""Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.<br/><br/>On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.<br/><br/>Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.<br/><br/>If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.<br/><br/>To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.<br/><br/>If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.<br/><br/>Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally.

So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags?

Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.<br/><br/>A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).<br/><br/>Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.<br/><br/>The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.<br/><br/>The game comes in two versions.

First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.<br/><br/>Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.<br/><br/>Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.<br/><br/>Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.

Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.<br/><br/>Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.<br/><br/>Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.<br/><br/>The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.

The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.<br/><br/>The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:<br/>1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.<br/>2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.<br/><br/>Stimmt So! A description of this version:<br/>Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six <br/>different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.<br/><br/>Al Capone  A description of this version:<br/>Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.<br/><br/>Other versions/re-themes:<br/>Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme. Originally as a limited run for Bonn, Germany and surrounding areas. There is also a Alhambra New York card game which is currently out of print, as well as an Alhambra Nederland card game. The re-themes are collectors items that people like to collect.<br/><br/>Player Counts:<br/>Earlier versions typically had a player count of 3-6 players while more recent versions, such as New York, is listed as 2-6 players.<br/><br/>"",1992,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.<br/><br/>To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players.

"433,Shark,""['Commodity Speculation', 'Dice Rolling', 'Stock Holding']"",['Economic'],""Shark is a stock-trading game slightly reminiscent of Acquire in that abstract play on the game board determines the share values of the various companies.  The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you can buy shares (up to five) and sell shares (as many as you want), then you roll dice to determine which of the four company markers you place on the board and in which region. A company marker on its own doesn't contribute to the value of a company; only groups of at least two markers count, so groups of 5, 4, 1, and 1 markers would create a value of $9,000 for each of that company's shares. If you place a marker that combines those two lone markers, then you'd have groups of 5, 4, and 3, so the share price would shoot to $12,000. If you placed that marker on its own, the share price wouldn't change. When you place a marker, you gain money equal to that company's new share price, so you have an incentive to boost a company's size &mdash; but all players receive funds equal to the difference between the old share price and new for each share they hold, so are you enriching them more than yourself?<br/><br/>Of course, you can also place a marker to tank a company's share price. When a company's group expands to touch a smaller group, that smaller group is removed from the board, lowering the value of that company's shares (as long as the group had at least two markers) and costing everyone money equal to the loss in value. (Groups of equal size cannot touch, and you cannot place a marker to force a smaller group to touch a larger one.) To end your turn, you can again sell as many shares as you want and buy shares up to the per-turn limit of five.<br/><br/>Removed markers are banished from the game, not returned to the supply. Once all of a company's markers have been used, or a company's share price reaches $15,000, or all of the shares have been sold, the game ends, and players cash out all their shares to see who has the most money.<br/><br/>"",1987,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.<br/><br/>Which beef baron will most cleverly play his cards?<br/><br/>Players have 10 cards to play which specify a number of cows.  Each round features a simultaneous selection of 2 of the 10 cards and a designation of which of the several pastures (the number of pastures in the game depends on the number of players) you'll try to place the cows in.  The tricky part starts with the rule that no two players can ever have exactly the same number of cows in a given pasture.  So if you plan to put 4 cows in a certain pasture, but somebody else has exactly 4 there already when your turn comes around, you'll only get to put 3 of them in -- and if somebody else has exactly 3 there already, you'll only get to put 2 of them in.

The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.<br/><br/>Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room!

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.<br/><br/>This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.<br/><br/>Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.<br/><br/>An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are over 25,000 different cards from which to build your deck!<br/><br/>Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.<br/><br/>Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.<br/><br/>Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.<br/><br/>"",1993,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jumps can be long; if the kangaroo to be jumped over is five spaces away, for example, the landing space will be five spaces beyond. The other option &mdash; to move a kangaroo just one space &mdash; is usually used as a positioning tactic for a subsequent move.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don't know which mission they must fulfill!<br/><br/>In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.<br/><br/>The first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.<br/><br/>There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.<br/><br/>The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.<br/><br/>"",1988,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After the players have placed all of their chips, then each of the areas is resolved.  The bottom part of the board is where players attempt to gather treasure tokens, which is the overall currency of the game.  The middle part of the board features a number of special actions, which help the players cast spells, trade in their resource tokens, or block other players' actions.

The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.<br/><br/>The Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.<br/><br/>It was re-released in 2022 by DiceTree Games with deluxe components, new maps, and new variants (by the designer).<br/><br/>"",1989,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You each have a dueling block, showing peace or war.
