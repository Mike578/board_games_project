"500,MARK,[],['Economic'],""MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.<br/><br/>The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.<br/><br/>If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>"",1997,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).  You get a sloping rack in the shape of a dragon tail and at the start of the game pick the order for your wind stones on your rack, putting one stone underneath your own dragon at its starting position.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw the bottom stone from your rack, place it (in the wind direction indicated) next to a dragon on the board, your dragon or another player's, and move the dragon onto your stone.  The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.<br/><br/>You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.<br/><br/>The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.<br/><br/>Although the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and &quot;Let's do it again!&quot;<br/><br/>"",1992,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.<br/><br/>After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points.

The game was later re-released as the slightly modified Krieg und Frieden (War and Peace) by TM Spiele.  Players are feudal lords that rule their own land and seek to help King Charlemagne build pieces of his castle.  The entire game is made from wood, in a light, clear stain, including the over-sized game board.  Each turn is four seasons, and play continues until all six pieces of the ornate castle are placed.  Players use their resource tiles to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available. Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build Charlemagne's castle.

"535,Power Barons,[],['Card Game'],""from the general Comment:<br/>This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.<br/><br/>If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.<br/><br/>"",1986,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"538,Manager,""['Commodity Speculation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Stock Holding']"",['Economic'],""Manager is a deceptively simple game of economics for up to six players. Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products. (It is strongly hinted that the products are computers.) The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.<br/><br/>The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.<br/><br/>The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't. The companies that got shut out of the market lose ground. The companies that sold their product gain, with the one who got the highest price gaining the most.<br/><br/>There is room for all kinds of maneuvering in the game. After the first few rounds, you make more money on the stock market than you do running your company, so you can actually drive your company into the ground--advancing someone else's company--and come out ahead.<br/><br/>"",1979,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario.

The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.<br/><br/>Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics.

In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;<br/><br/>The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.<br/><br/>You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.<br/><br/>Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game.

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.<br/><br/>Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.<br/><br/>Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.<br/><br/>Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if there are no empty streets at one of the ends or the line ends on the crossing as another player's end. All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk!

The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.<br/><br/>For those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges. If correctly placed per the rules, the routing will allow for all trains to score, albeit not necessarily for the high run value the owner would like to attain.<br/><br/>The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Cable Car<br/><br/><br/>"",1997,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is no playing board; it has been replaced by Terrain cards which become the &ldquo;hexagons&rdquo; of the game as players maneuver their forces via Action cards over constantly changing terrain. The scale of the game is measured in terms of relative ranges between opposing forces, with most combat occurring within a scale distance of 500 meters during the course of player turns measured in varying seconds of actual time.<br/><br/>UP FRONT is a game player&rsquo;s game, rich in detail yet easily playable within the space of a lunch hour. However, it also contains engrossing Multi-Player and Campaign Game versions which could last a week or more. Like SQUAD LEADER, UP FRONT is an open-ended game capable of depicting endless Design-Your-Own variations of small unit actions between American, German and Russian combatants. Tanks, Assault Guns, Smoke, Anti-Tank Rifles, Demolition Charges, Pillboxes, Partisans, SS, Entrenchments, Anti-Tank Mines, Infantry Guns, Flamethrowers, Armoured Cars, Halftracks, Panzerfausts, Bazookas, Panzerschrecks, Wire, Ambushes, Radios, Artillery, Minefields, Mortars, Snipers, Starshells, Heroes, Prisoners and Fords are all accounted for. In fact, UP FRONT encompasses almost everything that the SQUAD LEADER game system has taken four gamettes to do, and does so in a far more playable format. The game can be summed up in four words: Innovation, playability, detail and realism. That&rsquo;s an unbeatable combination.<br/><br/><br/>UP FRONT is rated 4 on the Avalon Hill Complexity scale of 1 (easy) to 10 (difficult).<br/><br/>Recommended for two or more discriminating players of skill, ages 12 &amp; up.<br/><br/>Each game includes: <br/><br/>     162 full-colour, quality 2&frac14;&quot; &times; 3 &frac12;&quot; playing cards<br/>     120 full-colour 2&quot; &times; 2.6&quot; infantry cards<br/>     40 full-colour 2.3&quot; &times; 3.1&quot; AFV cards (maybe 39 cards?

Generally speaking, each player is given thirteen cards and a partner who sits across the table.  Each player bids the number of tricks they'll take, and then the partners collectively attempt to take at least as many as they bid.  The tricks are fairly standard with following suit if you can, and spades as the trump suit.  If you make your bid you earn ten times the number of tricks you bid, otherwise you lose that many points.  Plus there is usually a nil bid, which means you personally won't take any tricks but your partner still plays as normal.<br/><br/>Call Break is a popular variation of Spades among card game players in South Asian countries.

"593,Favoriten,['Betting and Bluffing'],['Racing'],""Favoriten is a simple betting/race game with a nifty element of press-your-luck thrown in.<br/><br/>Five horses are involved in each of three races.  Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.<br/><br/>That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. &quot;I'll back the green horse&quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.<br/><br/>Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).<br/><br/>The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.  If you back an unpopular horse, you'll watch it lag behind.  If you wait until everyone else is pushing a particular horse, you gain very little for joining the bandwagon late in the game.<br/><br/>"",1989,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.<br/><br/>A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.<br/><br/>Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game.

Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared.

It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.<br/><br/>Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.<br/><br/>Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck.

"611,Ironman Football,['Events'],['Sports'],""Ironman Football is a team management game based on gridiron football in the early 1920's. That was a time when there were no TV million$, no real passing game as they played with a squashed medicine ball, shoulder padding was a sturdy arrant jumper, helmets were strictly optional and you were expected to play on both offense and defense.<br/><br/>The game features such notable institutions as the Pottsville Maroons, the Dayton Triangles and the Frankford Yellowjackets, and mega stars like Red Grange, George Halas, Jim Thorpe and Paul Robeson.<br/>        <br/>The game works on the old system of pulling a team together, playing a series of games, whacking down some event cards and trying to obtain the best record to win the league.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you are handed some event cards, a league franchise, a team name and, unless you are very unlucky, a handful of star players. You also get some money.   Your core players, the poor faceless grunts in the trenches, are abstracted into a simple team rating and a total salary bill (excellent idea) but the star players, the backs and ends, are each given their own individual card. As team manager, it is your job to balance the huge benefits of having these talented individuals on your staff with the interestingly high salaries they demand for performance.<br/><br/>The three key areas of offense, defense and special teams can all be enhanced by the star cards.<br/><br/>In addition to the player-controlled teams, who will usually play each other twice, the game also supplies a range of 'autopilot' opponents. There are league teams who are often as good, or even better, than the players' lineups and also sandlot teams.<br/><br/>Event cards add a lot to almost any the game. They can be played either before your weekly scheduled game or during the game itself. Their effects are wide ranging; from new gadget plays that can give you an extra dice on offense, to sponsorship deals that enable you to sell out to local government for big money. There are college players, fan loyalty, rain insurance, scams, scandals, intrigue and even subtle stuff like players' agents, loyalty and defections.<br/><br/>Once you have played the game, you work out the gate receipts, which are divided between the home team and the visitors based on a pre-agreed percentage split. There are variables such as number of star players on show, rain, home opener, whether you are playing a winning team, etc. As it is more profitable to be at home (no travel expenses) and to play the winning teams with the most star players, each team has an inherent draw factor - remember this is pre-TV - and can negotiate and earn high income accordingly. Want to play the top rated Canton Bulldogs (8-0-2, three star players) at home? You are going to have to offer their boss a healthy enticement to come to Oolong and perform against your 0-5 Indians, just to earn some money to pay off your overdraft.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, having pocketed your share of the take, you must pay all the players their salaries and if you can't meet the payroll, you will start to lose staff. They may stay on out of the goodness of their hearts, but you also need to apply to the league for a stay of financial execution and avoid bankruptcy. All this links into the league structure. If you have any sort of claim against your opponent you may appeal and have your rival reprimanded or fined, and always at the back of your mind is simply surviving game to game. You must maintain a winning record, you need to find new players to satisfy the butcher's bill of game injuries and, if you survive all that and play nine games well, you'll get a shot at the league title. Interestingly, the game can be won by other means than just having the best record. The team with the most money also gets a point, and a winning season will accrue another.

There are 36 pieces, 18 red, 18 white, which are placed on the intersections between the squares; they have little knobs which hold them in the slots.  On his turn, a player uses one of his pieces to push a row of his opponent's pieces off the board, a la Kuba.

Cards are numbered 1-37 and are found in three colors, red (comprising largely the highest numbers), blue (mostly in the middle) and yellow (mostly the lowest numbers) with colors being analogous to the suit in a standard deck.  There is one neutral card, the 19, that sets the &quot;price of the bottle.&quot;<br/><br/>The entire deck is dealt to the three or four players in the game and then, similarly to hearts, cards are exchanged and a card is played to the bottle.  As per the usual elements of a trick taking game, players must follow suit if possible with high card taking the trick (regardless of suit).  The unique feature about this game however is how trump is determined.  Any card of value lower than the current price of the bottle (starting with 19) is considered &quot;trump&quot; and will win the trick.  If multiple cards are less than the current bottle price, the card valued closest to the current price (so highest card below the bottle) takes the trick AND THE BOTTLE, the bottle price is adjusted by the player taking the card that represents the current bottle price and replacing it with the card they used to win the trick.  Thus the price of the bottle will decrease with each trump card played, and the bottle is increasingly harder to win/purchase.  Ownership of the bottle will pass from player to player and the number of possible trump cards will decrease both as a factor of cards being played and cards being skipped as the bottle price descends.  One player will be stuck with the bottle at the end of a hand (when players have played all the cards in their hands).<br/><br/>Cards have point values from 1-6 (not directly based on numerical value), at the end of the hand players will score points for the cards of tricks they've won, except the player who holds the bottle who will score NEGATIVE points for all the cards played to the bottle at the beginning, scoring nothing for the cards they won during the hand.

However, cards are played facedown until they're engaged, adding an element of bluff and doubt to the game. Each turn, players have as many actions as they have columns, and actions can be used to attack, draw cards, or play special action cards. To win, you need to reduce the other player to zero columns, capture their hostage card from their hand, or make sure your opponent cannot use all of their actions during their turn.<br/><br/>Hera &amp; Zeus is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>"",2000,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.<br/><br/>In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.<br/><br/>Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.<br/><br/>American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.<br/><br/>This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed.

These entertaining contests require strategy, intuition, and nerve to determine who survives and who doesn't.<br/>   <br/>This is an auction bidding game. Each round, the lead off player flips over a card from the deck which will then be auctioned off. There are also Hidden Resource cards in the deck. When one comes up, players bid for the next card in the deck without knowing what it is!  Each player has 6 bid markers: 3 Pass, 2 Stop, and 1 Strike. Each round of each auction, a player must place one of these markers face down. The first round, the markers are placed in the '5 position'. This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the '4 position'. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last '0 position'. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can't 'not bid'.

Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:<br/><br/>&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;<br/><br/>Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:<br/><br/>&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;<br/><br/>With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as<br/><br/>&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;<br/><br/>In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side.

Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.<br/><br/>Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.<br/><br/>The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. <br/> The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.<br/><br/>The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.<br/><br/><br/>Magazine References:<br/><br/>The GENERAL Index  Article List:<br/><br/><br/>    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5<br/>        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.<br/><br/>As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.<br/><br/>"",1987,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One player acts as game master, revealing the maze-like dungeon piecemeal as the players wander.  Up to four other players take on a character (wizard, elf, dwarf, or barbarian) and venture forth into dungeons on fantasy quests.  Plastic miniatures and 3-D furniture make this game very approachable.  Expansions were also released for this system.<br/><br/>The HeroQuest series consists of the main game and a number of expansions.<br/><br/>This game was made in cooperation with Games Workshop who designed the miniatures and helped in many of the production details including background world and art in the rule book and scenario book.<br/><br/>Additional material which is generally missed since it is not technically an expansion was published in the HeroQuest: Adventure Design Kit which did feature one more Heroquest adventure: A Plague of Zombies.<br/><br/>Other sources of HeroQuest

The sizeable game box comes stuffed with tons of plastic miniatures, a deck of combat cards and some dice.  Players move and fight their armies based upon what card is turned over from the deck.  Combat is held on a large vinyl mat 4.5 ft square (Actual Measurements: 55 inches by 57 inches).<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Battle Masters - the epic game where you command mighty armies locked in a legendary conflict of good versus evil!<br/><br/>The noble Imperial Army is ready to meet the Forces of Chaos. You and your opponent must strategically guide 25 army units, featuring over 100 finely-detailed figures, across the gigantic 4 1/2' X 5' Battle Mat. Beware!

You play against each other alternating as an attacker and a defender.  The attacker can select either a Fate or an Action card from draw piles.  Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.  For the shot on goal the attacker and the defender only roll one die a piece to simulate the shooter and the goalkeeper.<br/><br/>Fate cards are things that can happen during a game like red card, injuries, goalkeeper saves.

Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.<br/>The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.<br/>Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.<br/>War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist.

Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the &lsquo;olden days&rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.<br/><br/>In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.<br/><br/>Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes.

An important part of the game is provided by certain marked squares: if you can get your horse to stop on one of these it can overtake one horse ahead of it in the same line, which can be vital considering that only two swerves are permitted in each turn (only one if the jockey is an apprentice).

"827,Attila,""['Area Majority / Influence', 'Stock Holding']"",['Ancient'],""In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.<br/><br/>Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.<br/><br/>"",2000,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Players also have 2 special chits that either award extra points if played on a band that jumps to #1, or add/deduct points based on how far up (or down) a band moves from its original position. Some bands in the last 4 slots are removed at the end of a round depending on their original board position, and the top 3 are removed (one-hit wonders) once a player's score reaches the 30 and 50 point mark. The game ends once a player reaches 70 points total.

If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.<br/><br/>Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.<br/><br/>During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.<br/><br/>There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.<br/><br/>Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.<br/><br/>Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.<br/><br/>"",2000,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"934,Die Kette von Saba,""['Auction/Bidding', 'Tile Placement']"",['Economic'],""extrapolated from session report:<br/><br/>The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.<br/><br/>The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.<br/><br/>The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.<br/><br/>Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  <br/>Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.<br/><br/>The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:<br/><br/><br/>     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. <br/><br/><br/>Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.<br/><br/>The game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.<br/><br/>"",1984,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TwixT is a &quot;connection-type&quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. &quot;Connection type&quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.<br/><br/>Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.<br/><br/>Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.<br/><br/>After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.<br/><br/>On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.<br/><br/>When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>"",1962,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.<br/><br/>Dia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.<br/><br/>The first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.<br/><br/>The original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players.

The game's structure is simple: The defensive player selects one of 10 formation cards (ranging from an 8-man line &quot;goal line stand&quot; to a pass prevent defense with five safeties); the offensive player calls a play (a choice of 20, plus punting). Cross-indexing the choices on a matrix shows what happened. Except for &quot;long gains&quot;, the outcome of each play against each defense is always the same. Dice are rolled only to determine the distance of long gains and the results of kickoffs and field goal attempts.<br/><br/>Each play consumes a prescribed number of seconds, from 15 to 45. The players mark off the time and play four quarters, following the standard football rules.<br/><br/>For variety, three types of offense (&quot;pro style&quot;, &quot;aerial game&quot; and &quot;ball control&quot;) are available, each with a different, though not radically different, results matrix.<br/><br/>Simple though it is, the game is engrossing (see the &quot;More Information&quot; screen), and play generally follows realistic patterns, though the handling of punts and on-side kicks (both more effective than in real life) is questionable. Also, because the design changed little after its debut in 1959, the plays and defenses don't reflect the state of the art in contemporary professional football. This is the era of Otto Graham, not Eli Manning.<br/><br/>For those who are so inclined, Football Strategy lends itself to mathematical analysis. Many years ago, an entrant into the tournament at Origins went to the trouble of using game theory to generate charts showing the optimal mix of plays in different situations.

The deck consists of 36 cards, 6 thru Ace, in four suits: Hearts (red), Lizard (green), Raven (black) and Stars (yellow). The Cosmic characters are the heart of the game, providing each player with a special Cosmic power. Each player draws one randomly at game start.<br/><br/>In Cosmic Eidex, the idea is to take either the most points or the least points (designated by the trump and rank of the cards that you take each hand), to earn a victory point. If in a hand, one player exceeds 100 card points, then the other two players get 1 victory point each. If one player takes all of the tricks, she receives 2 victory points. Seven victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Cosmic Eidex is a mutation of the ages-old Swiss trick-taking card game Jass. Like Skat, the traditional German trick-taking card game, it is a three-player game.<br/><br/>The Cosmic-like powers each player is given are relatively weak. Most allow the player to break one of the rules once per game (before, during or after), some can be used multiple times. You don&rsquo;t need to know every characters' powers, just the powers of the three characters used in the current game.

Off to the right, Kruger&rsquo;s own men have located the source of the lethal shot and are laying down a steady stream of fire on the church steeple directly ahead. The absence of responding fire suggests that the lone Russian marksman has beat a hasty retreat or been victimized by the withering fire of the German retort. Kruger has seen enough. He is to occupy the church and set up a regimental observation post at once. His orders leave no leeway for delays by a single sniper. He gives the signal to rush the building. Obedient to their training, his men, veterans of France, the Balkans, and 18 months of fighting in Russia, spring to their feet. Seconds later the sharp, staccato retort of a Russian machinegun concludes with the assertiveness of death itself that this time Kruger was wrong...<br/><br/>This is Squad Leader...a game of WWII tactical combat in Europe. Now you make the instant decisions resulting in life or death for your men, victory or defeat for your army...for YOU are the Squad Leader. YOU direct the fire of your squad, select your plan of attack, or set your defenses against massed Russian human wave or armor assaults. Will that hedgerow provide adequate cover for your flanking efforts, or will your men be cut down by the American machinegun position in the woods? The decision is irrevocable and yours alone. You must live or die by the results.<br/><br/>Squad Leader utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 12 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The scenarios run the gamut from street fighting in Stalingrad to armored advances across snow covered roads in the Ardennes. A Campaign Game ties the individual scenarios together and allows your own personal leader counter to advance in rank and ability. In addition, a &ldquo;Design Your Own&rdquo; section is included so that players can create an unlimited number of play situations of their own creation.<br/><br/>Each hex in Squad Leader represents 40 meters of real terrain with counters representing individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles or 4 man crews and 12 man squads. Each game turn is divided into two player turns with 8 phases, equivalent to two minutes of actual time.<br/><br/>Squad Leader is more than just a game, it is a game system which can be used to portray any WWII infantry action. Its innovative system does for infantry combat what Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader have done for armored warfare games. Squad Leader provides innovative rules for morale, leadership, machineguns, flamethrowers, demo charges, smoke, hidden placement, sewer movement, off-board artillery, radio contact, anti-tank guns, night actions, wire, entrenchments, mines, bunkers, rubble, multi-story building differentiation, fire, river crossings, roadblocks, mortars, and much more.<br/><br/>Be forewarned! Squad Leader is not an easy game. Do not attempt it without prior wargaming experience. Squad Leader is rated Tournament Level IV on the A.H. Complexity scale.<br/><br/>In each game you get:<br/><br/><br/>    520 two-sided &frac12;&rdquo; die cut counters representing the men and weapons of the German, Russian, and American armies of WWII.<br/>    192 two-sided ⅝&rdquo; die cut counters representing fortifications and individual vehicles of the combatants.<br/>    Big 22&rdquo; x 28&rdquo; four section, full-colour GEOMORPHIC mapboard which can be arranged to make literally hundreds of different terrain configurations that can represent large cities, small villages, wooded hillsides, or even the flat plains of the Ukraine. <br/>    Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rules of play and designer&rsquo;s notes booklet.<br/>    Scenario cards for the first 12 carefully constructed game situations.<br/>    Two highly refined Quick Reference Data Cards which reduce the complexities of a realistic infantry combat game into easily playable proportions. <br/><br/><br/>"",1977,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"1038,Magnetic Tantrix,""['Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement']"",""['Abstract Strategy', 'Puzzle']"",""Tantrix is a strategy game using painted synthetic resin hexagons (often mistakenly thought to be Bakelite). It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.<br/><br/>Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).<br/><br/>The full version contains 56 tiles.<br/><br/>Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4). Increase the level of difficulty by adding the fifth tile, then 6th tile etc. Comes in Green &amp; Black.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Tantrix Gobble<br/>    The Mind Game<br/>    Kaliko (Psyche-Paths)<br/><br/><br/>"",1991,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.<br/><br/>Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, Smith &amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.<br/><br/>Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex. These boards can be assembled in varying ways to create a vast number of different maps that are used in the gunfights. The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.<br/><br/>Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.

The course of mankind's bloody history has taken many a turn due to the assassin's bullet.  Any successful leader--whether criminal, business scientific religious or political--can suddenly become a target in these modern days.  The assassin strikes without warning, at the least expected time from the last expected quarter.  Be he professional or amateur, the assassin's primary weapon is his ability to blend with his background, to be &quot;one of the crowd&quot;.  It is his skill at doing so that enables him, like the hunter in the wild, to surprise and kill his quarry.  Unbeknownst to you, the world's greatest assassin could be your brother or sister, your spouse, your child or parent, or your friend seated beside you.  Perhaps you yourself are the next &quot;Jackal&quot;.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is a challenging card/board game for 3-6 players, aged ten and up.  Played against the backdrop of modern Europe, players travel about the board, scoring points for visiting as many cities as possible.  But beware, for some unknown reason one among the players is an &quot;Assassin&quot;, who scores even more points by making a &quot;Hit&quot; when in the same city as another.  Perhaps the intercession of an &quot;Interpol Officer&quot; might save you; perhaps not.  Perhaps an &quot;Espionage Agent&quot; will alert you to who among the players is the threat; perhaps not.  Perhaps the assassin will hit an &quot;Innocent Bystander&quot; instead of you' perhaps not.  And the players never know when the turn of the next card in the deck will bring the game to an end.  Like our fast-paced world, the action in ASSASSIN is furious and challenging, with just a hint of uncertainty and danger to add spice to the intoxicating mix.<br/><br/>Blessed with colorful and eye-catching artwork, Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is both educational and entertaining.  Playable in under 90 minutes, it is the perfect game for social gatherings.  The rules are easily mastered, and included numerous options to make the strategy more or less challenging, and playing time shorter or longer.  The play can e lighthearted and friendly, or ruthlessly competitive, the rules allow for either, depending upon the style of play and the desires of your group.  So, if you are ready to face the challenge of touring Europe while a killer stalks your heels, shuffle the cards and sit down to play ASSASSIN.<br/><br/>A fast-moving fun game for 3 to 6 friends to play in an evening!<br/><br/>"",1993,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You can ram someone by moving on top of them, higher die wins, loser goes back a space, both cars suffer hit points equal to the opposite roll.

These can fire missiles / guns / etc. at other cars, allow you to roll more movement dice, ignore terrain effects, etc. Unless the defender has a defense card, the attack card will specify a range (in range if vehicles are less spaces away than eg result of 2 dice) and the number of dice to roll to determine hit points. Trucks start with a lot of hit points to counter their low movement, bikes start with not many. Lose all your hit points and you can start again at half hit points, or attempt to hijack another car.<br/><br/>The track is about 100 spaces long, with some bridges / crossovers and 5 different terrain types. For example you need to roll multiples of 5 to move each snow space, 4 for oil spaces. There are obstacle spaces which allow you to pull an instantly applied obstacle card.

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.<br/><br/>Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.<br/><br/>There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable.

During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower.

The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.<br/><br/>The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.<br/><br/>Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing. The round ends when one player goes out, and scoring then occurs. Cards in your hand count as negative points.<br/><br/>This is #3 in the Mystery Rummy series.<br/><br/>"",2001,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In your turn, you draw from deck 1 which shows a 1,2 or 3 hex tile and a number on the winter/spring header/footer. After placing the tile in the hex-board, you then draw an action card from deck 2.

Then the player can move their truck up to free places.<br/><br/>A 3-hex ice tile counts as one space, so a player with a shorter route may profit early, but when the thaw comes, the other players can quickly remove the shortcut.

It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware!

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>Cultural impact on rules<br/>Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.<br/><br/>Background<br/>In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).<br/><br/>Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.<br/><br/>The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Landlord's Game<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/>Official<br/><br/>    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on<br/>    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game<br/>    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game<br/><br/><br/>Unofficial<br/><br/>    Super Add-Ons: Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)<br/>    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)<br/>    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion (fan expansion for Monopoly)<br/>    Mafiopoly<br/>    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck<br/>    Final Fantasy Monopoly<br/><br/><br/>"",1935,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.<br/><br/>The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.<br/><br/>There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.<br/><br/>1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.<br/><br/>Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.<br/><br/>Description by Steve Thomas:<br/><br/>1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose &quot;no trump&quot;. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.<br/><br/>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.<br/><br/>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.<br/><br/>A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.<br/><br/>"",1984,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.<br/><br/>Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:<br/><br/>Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.<br/><br/>The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.<br/><br/>The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.<br/><br/>Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.<br/><br/>The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times.

It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!<br/><br/>Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to govern provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.<br/><br/>"",1990,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This allows already played words to change into different words by stacking new letters (up to a limit of 5 high). For example, LATE could be changed to CATER and then to BELATED. Instead of having different values for each letter, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted.  If the whole word is one tile high (no stacking), then the word scores 2 points per tile.  However, if there are any stacked tiles, you score one point per tile in the word, including those underneath.

At the start of the game, each player is assigned one of the six colors as their &quot;identity&quot; and is dealt six Commons and one &quot;Bonus&quot; card (which shows three pairs of colors). The Bis, Tris, Quads, and Quints are placed face up in separate piles in the center of the table.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player attempts to get higher numbered cards into their hand. The easiest way is by &quot;Trading.&quot; To trade, a player turns in a pair of cards with the same number of symbols but of opposite colors (one warm and one cool) and takes the top card from the stack with the next highest number of symbols. When they turn in two Quints, they gain a Monad. If the two cards turned in match one of the pairs on their bonus card, they may also draw the top card from each of the lower stacks. They may also use cards of the same color as their Identity as wild cards, which are treated as having any number of symbols.<br/><br/>The player can turn in more than two cards and &quot;Leap&quot; to a higher stack.

"1531,Ritter ohne Furcht und Tadel,['Betting and Bluffing'],""['Dice', 'Fighting', 'Medieval']"",""Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.<br/><br/>In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.<br/><br/>Each player also receives a 'lady' card.

A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).<br/><br/>The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.

"1534,Jump!,['Simultaneous Action Selection'],['Aviation / Flight'],""The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. <br/>The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.<br/><br/>Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.<br/><br/>The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.<br/><br/>When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.<br/><br/>Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!<br/><br/>Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.<br/><br/>"",1998,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)<br/><br/>As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.<br/><br/>The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleTech: BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.<br/><br/>BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.  Also common are map sets, which add additional mapsheets for scenario variety; era-based sourcebooks detailing the history and factions of the setting; and the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).<br/><br/>For about six years the game was known as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;, to differentiate it from the WizKids-produced collectible miniatures game &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot;.

TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.<br/><br/>TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).<br/><br/>The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.<br/><br/>Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.<br/><br/>TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Operação MX-1, was released in Brazil.

Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.<br/><br/>The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.<br/><br/>When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.<br/><br/>Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.<br/><br/>Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system.

"1585,""Burma: The Campaign in Northern Burma, 1944"",""['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid']"",""['Wargame', 'World War II']"",""Burma - The Campaign for Northern Burma, March-August, 1944, is the sixth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) from The Gamers, and covers covers the 1944 campaigns beginning with the Japanese &quot;U-Go&quot; offensive and ending up as what would be know as Imphal-Kohima, the most dramatic defeat ever inflicted on a Japanese army.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1944, two equally matched opponents faced each other in the jungles and mountains of Northern Burma. During that spring and summer, three independent, but simultaneous, dramas unfolded. In the west, the Japanese launched an all-out offensive to capture Imphal. In the center, the Chindits landed in the Japanese rear area. In the east, the Chinese/US forces moved toward Myitkyina against stubborn Japanese defenses. These battles took place in horrible terrain under the most difficult conditions imaginable with troops whose quality ranged from the world&rsquo;s best to the world&rsquo;s worst.<br/><br/>Burma contains British, Indian, US, and Chinese troops of varying qualities with ample opportunities for both sides to attack and defend.<br/><br/>While mainly a British and Indian show, the campaign would end up involving US (Galahad) and Chinese troops as well. Burma is the most markedly different of the OCS games, with a wide variety of unit types and qualities, the extremely dense terrain and lack of roads creating a challenging supply situation for both sides, and a more balanced situation as both sides have opportunities to attack and defend. There is more of the &quot;cool stuff&quot; too, with Galahad, Chindits, Gurkhas, lots of air supply, elephant and oxen transport options creating some interesting situations, and the ever-enigmatic and unusual Japanese Army. Imphal-Kohima is by far the most interesting ground campaign of the PTO (from an operational perspective), and it's conversion to OCS is remarkably smooth, with a fairly modest set of game-specific rules.<br/><br/>Unlike some other OCS games, Burma has an excellent range of scenarios, from a couple very short scenarios (1-2 hrs) through to a good selection of longer (6hr) scenarios and on up to 3 monster campaign games (30-60 hrs).<br/><br/>Scenario Info:<br/><br/>    Learning Scenario: 1/8th of Map B; 5 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 1 - Operation Thursday: 1/4 of Map B; 9 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 2 - U-Go: 3/4 map of Map B; 10 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 3 - Merril's Marauders: 3/4 map, but requires both maps to play; 24 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 4 - Sato's Dilemna: 1/2 map of Map A; 11 turns<br/>    Short Scenario 5 - Imphal: 1/2 map of Map A; 17 turns<br/>    Campaign Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 (which use both maps, obviously); 45, 41, and 31 turns respectively<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Burma II - printed 2008):<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 840 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS version v4.0 rules booklet<br/>One 40-page Burma II specific rules booklet<br/>Two 4-sided OCS v4.0 Charts &amp; Tables booklets<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 1 or more (also suitable for solitaire and team play)<br/>Playing Time: 1 to 60 hours<br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>"",1999,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"1588,Bauernschlau,['Secret Unit Deployment'],""['Farming', 'Memory']"",""The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.<br/><br/>The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).<br/><br/>The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:<br/><br/>1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.<br/><br/>Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.<br/><br/>"",1991,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The relationship to Monopoly is so blatant that at the start of the rules (and in the rules' largest font) is this quote: &quot;This game plays similarly to the famous Monopoly game.&quot;<br/><br/>The board features a rectangular track with spaces for each movie featured in the game (akin to Monopoly properties).  There are also Tombstone Award and Dead or Alive spaces (causing card draws, as with Chance and Community Chest in Monopoly).  Finally, there are Ghoul Agency spaces that allow you to draw and purchase actor cards.<br/><br/>As you travel around the board, you buy movies and acquire stars.  There are two actors associated with each movie and upon landing on a Ghoul Agency space you draw three actors for possible purchase.  You can attempt to buy any actors who are in a movie that you already own or, if none match, you may still choose to purchase one of the three cards drawn.  The price of an actor card is determined by a roll of the dice, multiplied by a base dollar amount.<br/><br/>Completing a production (acquiring the movie card and both associated actor cards) requires other plays to pay you a fee if they land on the movie's space on the board (making the actors somewhat like adding houses to a property in Monopoly).  Also, having a completed production allows you to draw a card when you land on an award space.  If you win a major award, you place it on the movie and anyone landing there has to pay you a premium (similar to having a hotel on a property in Monopoly).<br/><br/>"",1975,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.<br/><br/>Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.<br/><br/>Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.<br/><br/>During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.<br/><br/>Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.<br/><br/>Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.<br/><br/>Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there.

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.<br/><br/>The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.<br/><br/>Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).<br/><br/>The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.<br/><br/>Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.

Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.<br/><br/>In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!<br/><br/>Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards.

"1647,Spammers,[],['Card Game'],""FROM the SESSION REPORT:<br/><br/>Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.<br/><br/>Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.<br/><br/>You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.<br/><br/>Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.<br/><br/>To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.<br/><br/>"",1998,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.

Was it Tordek in the Dragon's Lair with the Flaming Battle Axe? Or Mialee in the Dungeon with the Staff of Power?<br/><br/>In Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a group of heroic adventurers has been called to the Archmage's castle, but one of those heroes isn't who he appears to be; one of the heroes is a doppelganger, a monster that can look like anyone! In the darkest part of the night, the doppelganger kills the Archmage, triggering a spell that seals the castle until the monster is caught. Now, in the grand tradition of Clue, the six suspects must determine which one of them is the doppelganger: Regdar the Human Fighter, Tordek the Dwarf Fighter, Lidda the Halfling Rogue, Mialee the Elf Wizard, Ember the Human Monk or Nebin the Gnome Wizard. The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.<br/><br/>For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.<br/><br/>One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).<br/><br/>"",2001,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"1665,Airport,""['Roll / Spin and Move', 'Track Movement']"",""['Aviation / Flight', 'Economic', 'Transportation']"",""In Airport, the goal is to create the most profitable airline. The players start with a fixed number of aircraft which they distribute among the routes on the board. They then take turns rolling dice and moving their counters around the board.<br/><br/>When a player lands on certain squares, he is paid for all aircraft he has on a particular route. The more aircraft there are on a single route, the lower the payment received for each aircraft. For example; on the New York to Seattle route, one aircraft will make $40,000. If there are 5 aircraft on the route, then each aircraft will earn $15,000, for a total of $75,000. All players receive payment for their aircraft on the route regardless of who landed on the square. Other squares on the board require the players to make certain payments (such as landing fees or ground service charges).<br/><br/>The players are also required to perform maintenance on their aircraft. Airport cards can be drawn which give individual players bonuses (such as a mail cargo route) or penalties (such as a strike). The players also have the option of buying or leasing new aircraft or of selling old aircraft back to the bank. The first player to reach a net worth of one million dollars is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is another variant on the venerable Monopoly game. The varying amount of payment based on the number of aircraft on a route is actually somewhat realistic, but otherwise it has about as much to do with how airlines are actually run as Monopoly does with actual real estate investment. But the flavor is good, and the game is interesting to play and reasonably fast.

The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.<br/><br/>Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.<br/><br/>This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.<br/><br/>Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.<br/><br/>"",1989,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The current opinion is always known, and a possible (but not necessarily accurate) forecast of future preferences is also provided.<br/><br/>Each turn, public opinion changes (sometimes to match the forecast, and sometimes into something completely random), then players use a bidding system to acquire contracts with performers.

All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.<br/><br/>Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.<br/><br/>The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.<br/><br/>The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.<br/><br/>The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.<br/><br/>But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it.

This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.<br/><br/>The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.<br/><br/>Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.<br/><br/>Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.

Tintin, the famous reporter, and Captain Haddock, the old sea-wolf, knew that, since the previous week, rumours abounded about the Professor&rsquo;s invention. They went to his laboratory, accompanied by Milou, Tintin&rsquo;s dog, and the detectives Dupond and Dupont, summoned in great haste.

"1735,Evade,""['Secret Unit Deployment', 'Square Grid']"",['Abstract Strategy'],""Evade is an old (1971) 3M game, part of their  series of 'Gamettes', games which were released in very small, fold-over bookcase type boxes.  There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.<br/><br/>Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.<br/><br/>Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  &quot;Well&quot;, you say, &quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?&quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>"",1971,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A plan had come to him.<br/><br/>A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool. Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of raids on the Empire&rsquo;s farmlands.

Each person has a boat (actually a hexagonal piece with the numbers 1-6 written on each of the 6 sides of the piece). The board is a long track of hexes that wind back and forth in an 'S' pattern. Each person places his 'boat' on the start space with one of the numbers facing forwards. Each person also starts with a number of 'Logs'. These are used to move your boat forward 1 space for each log spent. (You can also decide to move backwards - gaining 1 log for each space moved back).<br/><br/>Now comes the complication - bumping. If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces. Now you check to see if your boat is adjacent to another boat and if so repeat the bumping procedure.<br/><br/>If your boat is next to more than 1 boat, and has at least 1 positive difference, your boat moves forward. If you have more than 1 positive, add them together and move forward that distance. If you have a negative difference the other boats move in clockwise order.<br/><br/>For subsequent turns - you can freely change the facing (&amp; thus the hex side number facing forward) by 60 degrees. Moving it further than 1 hexside costs you 1 &quot;log&quot; per extra 60 degree facing change. You then decide whether to move forward or back and resolve any bumping.<br/><br/>The first boat to the finish wins.<br/><br/>"",1987,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Devil Bunny hates the Earth, for reasons best left known to people who bother to think about such things, and has decided to have his revenge by releasing upon this world the most unsatisfying brand of saltwater taffy known to man.  You and your friends have devised a way to stop him, however.  By luring cute and cuddly little squirrels into the factory and getting them to gum up your works (presumably doing unpleasant things to the squirrel, too) you think you might be able to break yourself, thus foiling Devil Bunny's plot.  Sure, it's a half baked idea, but you're taffy pulling machines, not scientists.  Besides, Devil Bunny's plot isn't likely to succeed anyway.<br/><br/>The game focuses on distribution of tokens (representing squirrels) in a linear fashion eventually leading to your machine.  However, on certain rolls of the dice, Devil Bunny will come out onto the board and repair (remove tokens from) a machine.

Although only a single deck of strategy cards is used, &agrave; la We the People, the two sides are dramatically different in character: the French are irregular-heavy (especially Indians) and rely on raiding to tie down the superior numbers of British Regular &amp; Provincial drilled troops, who will themselves be intent on sieges and trying to force a pitched battle. Like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, the fortunes of war turn as the game goes on: the French are masters early, with the crushing British manpower advantage accruing late.<br/><br/>Wilderness War takes two players into the French &amp; Indian War, 1755-1760, the climactic struggle between France and Britain for control of North America. It uses strategy cards and a point-to-point map similar to GMT's award winning For the People and Paths of Glory. Players maneuver and fight over a map stretching from Northern Virginia to Canada. As the leader of French or British forces in North America, you will need to defend your frontier, raid your enemy's frontier, build fortification networks through the harsh wilderness, recruit Indian allies, besiege forts and fortresses, and deal with events occurring in Europe that are above and beyond your control.<br/><br/>Wilderness War includes a deck of strategy cards for conducting campaigns and incorporating the many events and personalities of the war. The French player can recruit up to sixteen different Indian tribes as allies, secure a continental alliance in Europe against Great Britain, sortie his squadron at Louisbourg, force a ministerial crisis in London, and work toward draining support for the war from the provincial assemblies. The British player can recruit Mohawks and Cherokees, plan for and conduct amphibious operations, implement a global strategy via William Pitt, destroy the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and expel the Acadians.

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains &amp; generate revenue for shareholders.<br/><br/>This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.<br/><br/>The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain &amp; Scotland.<br/><br/>Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.<br/><br/>In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements. It plays quite differently from 1829, though, as 1829 was always about competition for routes.<br/><br/>The board gaming hobby has in its history a few landmark games, which redefine a part of board games in general, or even spawn an entire genre. 1829 is just such a landmark.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>    MSK 1 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 2 Extension Kit for 1829 (Southern & Northern boards)<br/>    MSK 3 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 5 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    MSK 6 Extension Kit for 1829 (Northern & Southern Boards)<br/>    1829 Conversion Kit<br/>    1829 Northern Board<br/><br/><br/>"",1974,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.<br/><br/>Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.<br/><br/>The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.<br/><br/>Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.<br/><br/>"",1992,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The deck of a little over a hundred cards is played through and then everyone scores.  Once the deck is exhausted, play continues until everyone's hand is also exhausted.  Once your hand drops below four cards, there are some limitations on card play that come into effect.<br/><br/>When developing a Territory you own, you ideally would play a 1, then a 2, and so on up to a 6.  The developments must be played in increasing numerical sequence, but they need not be consecutive.  At the end of the game, a territory scores the number of development cards on it times its basic multiplier (1&times;, 2&times; or 3&times;) - so an undeveloped territory is worthless.  If you managed to have a sequence of at least four consecutive developments on the territory, you score a sizable bonus.<br/><br/>Revolt cards prevent a territory from being developed or attacked; they also cancel an existing revolt card (there are only 8 of those in the deck).  It is sometimes good strategy to play a revolt on a territory of your own to prevent it from being attacked.<br/><br/>Cannon cards are used to attack other players' territories; you play a cannon face down, and so does the defender.  Both reveal their cards and add a die roll.  The attacker's total must beat the defender's for the attack to succeed.  When it does, you roll a die and this indicates how many cards you plunder from that territory.  If that roll is high enough, you can even steal the territory itself.

Besides Babylon 5, there was Hercules, Xena, and Star Trek. The Babylon 5 game was apparently derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name --Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and put their components in common to have a game. Pretty cool.<br/><br/>In the Babylon 5 game, you take control of a certain faction which is trying to gain power in the galaxy. You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are <br/>different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs. You can create decks for each player as per CCGs, or you can just draw from a common deck after handing out the empire specific cards.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>The game does a very good job of recreating the B5 universe, with play action matching pretty closely the series' happenings. In terms of mechanics, it is similar to Twilight Imperium and Les Cochons de l'espace.<br/><br/>There are two core sets, although CGS initially intended five (one for each of the show's seasons). They are the 2258 and 2259 Core Sets. The first was published in two formats, the 1997 first printing (Limited Edition; CB5-101) using a smaller, unimpressive box (they were in a hurry to get it to the store shelves by Christmas of that year), whilst the 1998 second printing (CB5-001) came in a beautiful large box (allowing room for the storage of extra sets) labeled as &quot;Babylon 5: The Board Game&quot;. The 2259 Core Set (CB5-102) was only published in the big box format. The core sets include the Earth Alliance, Narn Regime, Centauri Republic and Minbari factions, which were each available separately (although the core sets include some extra cards and stuff beyond the combination of the four individual Starter Kits). There is supposedly enough difference between the 2258 and 2259 core sets to warrant buying both, although I haven't received my 2259 set yet so I can't be sure.<br/><br/>Component Game Systems has now disappeared from the face of the earth, and even their domain name (<a target='_blank' href=""""http://www.c-g-s.com"""" rel=""""nofollow noreferrer noopener"""">www.c-g-s.com</a>) has been recycled by some unrelated outfit.<br/><br/>Part of the Component Game System.<br/><br/>"",1997,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.<br/><br/>War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:<br/><br/><br/>     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC<br/>     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC<br/>     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC<br/>     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)<br/>     The First Punic War<br/>         Ecnomus, 256 BC<br/>         Drepanum, 249 BC<br/>         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC <br/>    <br/>     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC<br/>     The War with Antiochus<br/>         Side, 190 BC<br/>         Myonessus, 190 BC <br/>    <br/>     The Civil War<br/>         Tauris, 47 BC<br/>         Naulochus, 36 BC<br/>         Actium, 31 BC <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>"",1999,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"1895,Salamis,['Hexagon Grid'],""['Ancient', 'Expansion for Base-game', 'Nautical', 'Wargame']"",""Add-on module for War Galley.<br/><br/>Salamis, one of the most famous naval battles in history, was a direct result of the Persian need to keep their large, invading army supplied by controlling the sea lanes. With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.<br/><br/>With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.<br/><br/>At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.<br/><br/>To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.<br/><br/>There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This &quot;action&quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides &quot;blockading&quot; and not fighting.<br/><br/>At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.<br/><br/>The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.<br/><br/>Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.<br/><br/>(from GMT website)<br/><br/>"",1999,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.<br/><br/>From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.  The second set of money (dollars) is thus actually a victory point counting device and not actual currency (i.e. it cannot be spent).<br/><br/>It works well with any number of players (when playing with a smaller complement, each player operates multiple mines) except five, as the competition factor on one side of the board is uneven with the other.<br/><br/>"",1965,,,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details.

If you think the price will rise, you buy or go 'long' of the commodity hoping that by the time the contract matures, you can sell them back at a profit. Conversely, if your hunch (or information) is that prices will fall, you sell or go 'short' thinking you can close out the deal at a lower price, again making money. So the logic is that whatever way the market moves, you can make profits - if you are right.    The one thing that this game does is give each person at least one chance to sell a contract at any time - not just on your turn - so if you think it is the perfect time - you can interrupt another player's turn to sell to lock in your profits.<br/><br/>The game is over after everyone plays their last card - and no new contracts can be started during the last round (1 card left).

If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.<br/><br/>You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces.

Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;<br/><br/>Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.<br/><br/>The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.<br/><br/>Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.<br/><br/>There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.<br/><br/>The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.<br/><br/>The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.<br/><br/>Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.<br/><br/>Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.<br/><br/>The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.<br/><br/>A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.<br/><br/>The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.<br/><br/>Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.<br/><br/>from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles.
